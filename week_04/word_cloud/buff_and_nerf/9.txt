		Greetings, summoners.
		Welcome to patch 6.10, the one after Midseason. We’re back to business as usual in terms of our layout this time. 6.9’s template is one we break out for special occasions, and ‘changing almost everything in League’ seemed to fit that description.
		Just as with any patch after a major update, 6.10’s mostly about reacting to whatever balance outliers remain after the tectonic shift. You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs - or in this case, a few mages. While we’re waiting for the dust to settle and the rest of the game’s landscape to really take shape, it’s clear that a few of our mage updates undershot (or overshot) expectations.
		While mages make up the bulk of 6.10’s tuning, reacting to other systemic shifts in the ecosystem (Bloodrazor, Ocean Drake) is still a top priority. Beyond that however, this 6.10 is pretty narrow in scope as we continue to evaluate how players are adapting to Midseason. There’s lots left to discover and play around still flying under the radar, so expect more focus as those builds and pocket picks shake out. Apparently people are succeeding with Skirmisher’s Sabre Bloodrazor bot lane Kog’Maw. If that’s not enough to get you experimenting, nothing will.
		We’ve also got some matchmaking fixes coming in later this patch aimed at reining in queue times and making more even matches at the top of the ladder. We’ll hit you up when the changes are good to go, so keep an eye on the front page.
		That’s all for us this patch! Check out the rest of the notes to find out exactly who’s changing and how, and we’ll see you on the rift looking for the next big thing. Shout-outs to the 5 Singed mains out there - these Ghost buffs are on the house.
		GL, HF.

Patch Updates

		
			
				
					Taliyah Balance Changes
				
				
					Q mana cost and Worked Ground duration reduced.
				
				
					Taliyah is struggling to find early-game success. We're easing up on Threaded Volley's restrictions, giving Taliyah more opportunities to secure lane victories she can translate into mid-game power.
					Quick note: since this is a mid-patch change, Taliyah's tooltips won't be updated until 6.11.
				
				
					Q - Threaded Volley
				
				
					COST 60/65/70/75/80 mana ⇒ 50/55/60/65/70 mana
				
				
					WORKED GROUND DURATION 180 seconds ⇒ 140 seconds

					Alistar
				
				
					R damage reduction down.
				
				
					Alistar's the definition of a professional staple, bringing consistent peel, initiation, and diving potential. We're not looking to change that, but when Alistar becomes too reliable he suffocates the rest of the support landscape. We've always been happy with Alistar breaking up the attrition of an all-ranged lane through the threat of tower-dives, but at present he's got too much of a good thing. We're toning back Ali's early-game ability to tank turret shots (and everything else) so opponents have a chance to play around his window of strength rather than just flee for its duration.
				
				
					R - Unbreakable Will
				
				
					DAMAGE REDUCTION 70% at all ranks ⇒ 50/60/70%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Anivia
				
				
					R radius and cast range increased. Mana cost down.
				
				
					The first of many follow-ups to our Midseason mage updates, we begin with Anivia. While we’re confident in the controlling shift we made with the Cryophoenix in 6.9, Anivia as a whole ended up less reliable in the process. With a heavier focus placed on Glacial Storm’s uptime, we’re making it easier for her to maintain her signature zoning tool.
				
				
					R - Glacial Storm
				
				
					COST PER SECOND 40/50/60 mana ⇒ 30/40/50 mana
				
				
					CAST RANGE 685 ⇒ 750
				
				
					INITIAL RADIUS 150 ⇒ 200
				
				
					SWAGSTORM Using Zhonya’s Hourglass no longer interrupts Glacial Storm
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Aurelion Sol
				
				
					W cooldown up. R damage down.
				
				
					While our last changes pulled him down from the heavens, Aurelion Sol’s still kicking as our biggest over-performer. Alas, when you’re a strong laner with amazing roaming and teamfighting - something’s gotta give. For this update, we’re focusing on hitting Sol’s in-fight reliability. As-is, Aurelion holds all the cards in any given engagement due to his Celestial Expansion’s amazing flexibility, forcing opponents to march to his beat. Putting some of the counterplay back into whether or not Aurelion can safely avoid being knocked out of his empowered state, as well as draining some his raw damage output, should see the Starforger less powerful (but no less magnificent).
				
				
					W - Celestial Expansion
				
				
					COOLDOWN 6/5/4/3/2 seconds ⇒ 6/5.5/5/4.5/4 seconds
				
				
					R - Voice of Light
				
				
					DAMAGE 200/300/400 ⇒ 150/250/350
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Cassiopeia
				
				
					Q and W ranges up. W cooldown decreased.
				
				
					One of the larger Midseason mage updates, Cassiopeia’s strengths as an immobilizing controller have been muted by a rather weak release state. Low ranges across her poisons appear to be the culprit, as Cassi quite literally lives or dies on her ability to access Noxious Blast’s burst of speed (or Miasma’s grounding). Add in some bonus usability to her poisons and Cassiopeia will see herself actually able to play her keep-away kite game without being overrun.
				
				
					Q - Noxious Blast
				
				
					RANGE 750 ⇒ 850
				
				
					SAVOR THE MOMENT Noxious Blast’s movement speed bonus takes longer to decay
				
				
					POISONOUS CLARITY “Poisoned” particle’s size has been increased
				
				
					W - Miasma
				
				
					COOLDOWN 22/20/18/16/14 seconds ⇒ 18/17/16/15/14 seconds
				
				
					MINIMUM RANGE 550 ⇒ 500
				
				
					MAXIMUM RANGE 800 ⇒ 900
				
				
					BRINGING IT BACK No longer stops upon hitting terrain
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Fiddlesticks
				
				
					E bounces down. More scarecrow.
				
				
					After a season in the shadows, Fiddlesticks is back with a vengeance following his spooky update. This patch is nothing complicated - we’re going to keep our eye as Fiddle continues to harbinge doom all over the place, but the clearing and dueling potential from Dark Wind was simply too high.
				
				
					General
				
				
					newSPOOKY After 5 seconds of not moving, Fiddlesticks will become a scarecrow
				
				
					E - Dark Wind
				
				
					NUMBER OF BOUNCES 7 ⇒ 6
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Fizz
				
				
					R’s fish can’t be cleansed.
				
				
					Due to the changes to Quicksilver Sash only removing crowd control, a nasty bug surfaced where any ability that cleansed slows (like Garen’s Q - Decisive Strike) would completely detach Fizz’s shark from the target. Rather than just reverting it to its previous behaviour, we’re instead making it consistent with QSS’s debuff interaction. Cleansing the slow will allow you to move at full speed, but won’t detach the shark. Like with QSS’s interactions with other high-profile abilities (ex. Zed’s R - Death Mark and Fiora’s R - Grand Challenge), we’ll be closely monitoring how these changes affect Fizz’s performance.
				
				
					R - Chum the Waters
				
				
					removedSHARKBAIT Cleansing Chum the Waters’ slow no longer detaches the shark from the target.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Illaoi
				
				
					W cooldown down.
				
				
					Following changes to her Test of Spirit, Illaoi’s found her performance a little lopsided this patch. Traditionally relying on a powerful laning phase to transition into strong teamfighting, Illaoi’s new vessel mechanics have reversed this dynamic. Now, Illaoi’s late-game vessel shenanigans are making a big splash, but it’s her early-game strength that’s been reduced significantly. We’re happy with the direction of the new Test of Spirit (i.e. providing a tangible benefit to Illaoi but not debuffing opponents for a million years), so we’re giving the Kraken Priestess a booster-shot to her early lane-bully potential to even things out.
				
				
					W - Harsh Lesson
				
				
					COOLDOWN 6/5.5/5/4.5/4 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Jinx
				
				
					Rocket attacks faster at level 1, but scales worse with attack speed.
				
				
					Our last round of changes to Switcheroo were targeted at differentiating Jinx’s weapons to make it clear when each should be useful. Pow-Pow’s minigun is for hyper-carry damage output at short range, while Fishbones’ rocket launcher is for poking and area damage at the cost of a significant amount of DPS uptime. We’re happy with how that’s played out, save one unintended goal: the usability of Jinxs’ level 1 rockets suffered immensely. Seeing how our previous change was about making rockets scale worse with items, we’re improving the feel and flow of Jinx’s trusty Fishbones for all of her destructive lane-bullying needs.
				
				
					Q - Switcheroo!
				
				
					FISHBONES BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.531 ⇒ 0.625
				
				
					FISHBONES ATTACK SPEED PENALTY 15% reduced bonus attack speed ⇒ 25% reduced bonus attack speed
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Malzahar
				
				
					Passive cooldown up.
				
				
					While our balance hotfix looks to have solved much of Malzahar’s over-the-top performance (like soloing dragons at level 3), Malzahar’s still ahead of the pack when it comes to mage dominance on 6.9. Void Shift is an important tool to facilitate Malzahar wading through the midlines to lockdown a priority target, but the cooldown is so flexible during laning that it makes most aggression feel meaningless. We’re dramatically increasing the windows opponents have to pull Malzahar out of the void and back to his fountain (especially early game).
				
				
					Passive - Void Shift
				
				
					COOLDOWN 23-6 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 30/18/10/6 seconds (at levels 1/6/11/16)
				
				
					VOID CLARITY Cooldown indicator is now also shown on buff bar
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Master Yi
				
				
					W ratio up. E damage up.
				
				
					Master Yi’s been on a bit of a wild ride when it comes to the patch notes, but now we find the Wuju Bladesman pretty far behind the curve. Specifically, changes to Guinsoo’s Rageblade and the removal of Sated Devourer’s got Yi feeling pretty confused about how he should be building in a post-midseason world. With Sated’s magic proc gone (and Bloodrazor’s damage being entirely physical), armor’s better protection against Master Yi than it’s ever been. Coupled with some changes to the new enchantment, tossing some power back in Yeezy’s true damage will help him melt through sturdier targets when he can’t reach the back line.
				
				
					W - Meditate
				
				
					RATIO 0.15 ability power per second ⇒ 0.25 ability power per second
				
				
					E - Wuju Style
				
				
					TRUE DAMAGE ON-HIT 12/19/26/33/40 ⇒ 14/23/32/41/50
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Nocturne
				
				
					Passive has an AP ratio.
				
				
					We know what you’re thinking, but let’s explain. There are an abundance of things in the game that give ability power incidentally (Guinsoo’s Rageblade, Baron Buff etc), making a number of champions sad when they can’t utilize it. Giving Nocturne an ever so slight ratio should make him feel better when these cases arise.
				
				
					Passive - Umbra Blades
				
				
					newRATIO Now additionally scales with 0.15 ability power per hit
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Shyvana
				
				
					W has an AP ratio.
				
				
					Pretty much the same thing as Nocturne’s context. Re-read that but pretend we said ‘Shyvana’ instead.
				
				
					W - Burnout
				
				
					newRATIO Now additionally scales with 0.1 ability power per second
				
				
					newRATIO ON-HIT Now additionally scales with 0.025 ability power on-hit
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Swain
				
				
					Health per level up. R heals more.
				
				
					Before we talk about Swain proper, consider this a public service announcement: Torment’s damage amplification is a flat 20% as of 6.9, which means you shouldn’t level it first.
					With that out of the way, let’s talk Swain. Simply put, Swain’s not being rewarded enough for his early-game successes, often being ignored or phased out as the game goes on. We’re looking to tackle this by reinforcing what he’s good at - taking hits on the front lines and being a sticky drain-tank, especially against teams with multiple tanks. At present, Swain’s healing is based on the damage dealt - meaning the more magic resist an opponent has, the less health. This means the burly tanks of the world that Swain’s meant to prey on in lane quickly turn predator, reducing both Swain’s damage and sustain through items. We’re flipping the script and letting Swain heal up on tanks with plenty to spare (as well as upping his own natural durability) to keep his fantasy of being contextually unkillable alive and well.
				
				
					General
				
				
					HEALTH GROWTH STAT 78 ⇒ 90
				
				
					Q - Decrepify
				
				
					HUNGRY FOR WORMS Now executes minions below 10 health
				
				
					NOW THEY WORK Fixed a bug where spell effects like Rylai’s Crystal Scepter and Liandry’s Torment weren’t applying properly
				
				
					R - Ravenous Flock
				
				
					HEALING VS CHAMPIONS 75% of the damage dealt ⇒ 30/45/60 (+0.1 ability power)
				
				
					HEALING VS MINIONS AND MONSTERS 15% of the damage dealt ⇒ 8/11/13 (+0.03 ability power)
				
				
					FLOCK TOGETHER Now prioritizes targets closest to Swain instead of picking them at random (still prioritizes champions over non-champions)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Taric
				
				
					R is more shiny.
				
				
					Even for someone that shines as bright as Taric, Cosmic Radiance can be a little hard to see in teamfights. Given how pivotal it is to know whether or not people are going to take damage (who’d have thought?), we’ve put some extra shine on Taric’s biggest moment.
				
				
					R - Cosmic Radiance
				
				
					WITH CLARITY Added a brighter particle that plays when units affected by Cosmic Radiance become invulnerable
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Tryndamere
				
				
					R holds you at a higher threshold. No longer restores 3% health if below.
				
				
					Tryndamere had an undocumented mechanic that would ensure you wouldn’t end at 1hp after his ult expired if you didn’t heal (which most people didn’t notice, because they’d usually heal after it ended). We’re just cleaning it up and putting it in the tooltip, since 3% of Tryndamere’s health almost always ended up at 30-70 health anyways.
				
				
					R - Undying Rage
				
				
					MINIMUM HEALTH 1 ⇒ 30/50/70
				
				
					removedAS I LAY DYING No longer heals Tryndamere to 3% of his maximum health (if he was below that) when Undying Rage ends
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Vel'Koz
				
				
					Passive and R ratios up.
				
				
					Vel’Koz’s update was meant to help solve his ‘spikes early but falls off’ power-curve by giving him meaningful scaling with ability power (and extra spicy lasers against researched targets). After a patch of careful research, it’s clear we didn’t go far enough to avoid VK’s drop-off, so we’re cranking up his scaling.
				
				
					Passive - Organic Deconstruction
				
				
					RATIO 0.4 ability power ⇒ 0.5 ability power
				
				
					R - Life Form Disintegration Ray
				
				
					RATIO 1.0 ability power ⇒ 1.25 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Vladimir
				
				
					R’s healing on champions increased. Q baits you less.
				
				
					Our resident blood-mage, Vladimir’s only partially living up to the expectations set in 6.9. Which is to say Vlad’s losing quite a lot of health, but not exactly gaining all of it back. Hemoplague promises a rewarding second wind for a well-placed ultimate, but falls short of being the lifeline necessary to enable Vlad’s health as a resource. We’re tuning back his risk/reward paradigm as well as some usability improvements to help Vladimir pull off the daring low-health plays he’s known for.
				
				
					Q - Transfusion
				
				
					RIPE FOR THE PICKING Crimson Rush’s particle now delays until just before Transfusion becomes available
				
				
					E - Tides of Blood
				
				
					ROLL TIDE Releasing Tides of Blood no longer prematurely cancels Sanguine Pool
				
				
					R - Hemoplague
				
				
					HEALING VS CHAMPIONS 50% of the damage dealt ⇒ 150/250/350 + 0.7 ability power, increased by 50% for each additional champion hit beyond the first
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Zyra
				
				
					Passive-spawned seeds can be stepped on faster.
				
				
					Zyra’s Midseason is off to a good start, comfortably blooming into a botanical powerhouse. We’re not looking to do anything dramatic - just adjusting Garden of Thorns to be less punishing for those on the wrong side of the grass.
				
				
					Passive - Garden of Thorns
				
				
					SEED GRACE PERIOD Can be stepped on 1.5 seconds after spawning ⇒ 1 second after spawning (W - Rampant Growth seeds remain at 1.5 seconds of immunity)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Splash Updates
				
				
					Tristana’s skin splashes have been updated:
				
				
				
					
						
						Buccaneer Tristana
					
					
						
						Earnest Elf Tristana
					
					
						
						Firefighter Tristana
					
					
						
						Guerilla Tristana
					
					
						
						Riot Girl Tristana
					
					
						
						Rocket Girl Tristana

			Summoner’s Rift
		
	
		
			
				
					Jungle Respawn Timers
				
				
					Red and Blue minimap respawn icons are smaller.
				
				
					The size of the buff icons were cluttering the minimap and giving the feeling that buff contests were as important as epic monsters. Bringing the size in line with the importance of buffs is a good way to clear up the minimap landscape to see other things like wards or traps.
				
				
					MINIMAP CLARITY Reduced the size of Red & Blue minimap respawn icons
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					First Minion Wave
				
				
					Consistency at the start of the game is what allows players to make laning decisions. We’ve been honing in on that consistency with small minion tweaks over many patches, but losing a ranged minion to random chance could occasionally change the dynamic of laning. Eliminating that outlier should give players clearer expectations about the laning phase.
				
				
					FOCUS ON THE FRONT Minions in the first wave should no longer grab an enemy ranged minion as a target randomly.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Mountain Drake
				
				
					Doesn’t amplify true damage.
				
				
					True damage offers pretty clear feedback: the damage you see is the damage you get, no decreases or increases. Mountain Drake was violating that expectation (especially around smite fights), so we’re bringing it in line with the rest of the game.
				
				
					Mark of the Mountain Drake
				
				
					TRULY OUTRAGEOUS No longer amplifies true damage (including Smite)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Ocean Drake
				
				
					Now restores health and mana only when out of combat with champions and towers.
				
				
					Regeneration effects often go unnoticed by their owners, but the Ocean Drake buff is large and spiky enough that players feel the individual ticks. The occasional lucky tick right before a killing blow, however, was adding more frustration than gameplay and often leaving players wondering if their damage hadn’t gone through. Tying the regen to stay out-of-combat allows more counterplay to opponents, allowing them to feel less like they’re fighting a rising tide. Of regeneration.
				
				
					updatedMark of the Ocean Drake
				
				
					SEA GOD’S CLAIM Restores 4/8/12% of your missing health and mana every 8 seconds if not damaged by a champion or tower in the last 5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Turrets
				
				
					Turrets now take less true damage when the backdoor bonus is in effect.
				
				
					Turrets have always had a pretty massive defensive boost to discourage raw backdoor attempts, but with the increased prevalence of True Damage in the game (Mountain Drake, Red Buff) we’re adjusting to keep it in line.
				
				
					REALLY REINFORCED ARMOR Now additionally absorbs 66% of true damage when the backdoor bonus is in effect
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Enchantment: Bloodrazor
				
				
					Attack speed and on-hit damage up.
				
				
					The new Bloodrazor allows junglers like Shyvana and Master Yi to feel more comfortable interacting with other players early on, rather than obligated to farm the jungle for twenty minions. That said, thanks to the relatively weak combat strength of Bloodrazor, they’re not enjoying the results of those interactions. Without being pinned to farming, attack speed junglers have reasons to duel enemy junglers, gank, or otherwise scrap for early-mid game advantages - they just need reasons to believe they can win those duels. Upping combat strength is the solution here.
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED 40% ⇒ 50%
				
				
					ON-HIT DAMAGE 3% of the target’s maximum health ⇒ 4% of the target’s maximum health

			Summoner Spells
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Barrier
				
				
					Cooldown decreased.
				
				
					Right now, Barrier doesn’t really have anything to differentiate it from Heal, leaving it outclassed by the less temporary nature of Heal. A lower cooldown should offer Barrier a unique identity as the go-to summoner spell against repeated assassin all-ins.
				
				
					COOLDOWN 210 seconds ⇒ 180 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Ghost
				
				
					Cooldown decreased. Movement speed scales with level.
				
				
					With the removal of Distortion Boots, Ghost lost out on the scaling power it had come to rely on. Given Ghost’s consistent underselection relative to Flash, buffing the summoner spell won’t make it a must take, while still keeping the late game feel it previously had.
				
				
					COOLDOWN 210 ⇒ 180
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED BONUS 27% at all levels ⇒ 28-45% (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
			Dynamic Queue
		
	
		
			
				
					Rolling out later this patch: several adjustments and improvements targeting high MMR matchmaking in dynamic queue. 
				
				
					Our goals are lowering queue times and improving match quality above Diamond tier with a set of solutions addressing those two issues. We’ll share more during this patch. 
				
			
		
	
	
			Champion Mastery
		
	
		
			
				
					Champion Mastery Levels 6 and 7 are coming this patch.
				
				
					Mastery Levels 6 and 7 better emphasize skill by requiring S grades from matchmade games. We’re emphasizing a performance requirement alongside a dedication component (the time needed to unlock free chests or earn IP for champ shards or permanent loot) to build on the original system’s blend of skill and participation. Keep an eye out for a larger announcement soon!
				
				
					MORE MASTERFUL MASTERY Earn new mastery badge emotes, loading screen border flags, and announcement banner upgrades for each level
				
				
					DING Earn Mastery 6 tokens for S-, S, and S+ games with champs that are Mastery Level 5
				
				
					DING DING Earn Mastery 7 tokens for S and S+ games with champs that are Mastery Level 6
				
				
					HEXTECH MASTERY Combine Mastery tokens for a specific champ with that champ’s crafting shard, permanent loot, or blue essence to unlock their next mastery level

			Greetings, summoners.
			Welcome to patch 6.9, the one where it's Midseason. You may notice the sweet new layout (if you're reading this in the patcher, we recommend heading to the web) - that's because this ain't your ordinary run-of-the-mill patch!
			Midseason is a time for us to reflect on what parts of Preseason worked and what didn't, and take large strides to keep League fresh. We identified two areas of improvement for Midseason: adding cohesion to the mage class, and shaking up the strategy surrounding objectives. Let's dive in.
			While thematically strong (who doesn't like casting spells?), mages have historically lacked a cohesive identity beyond 'damage that's magic.' Some are long-ranged, some are short-ranged, some are Fiddlesticks, you get the idea. A lack of clear expectations combined with the sheer size of the class means there's a lot of redundancy across the mage roster. In the end, this puts mages in a spot where the answer to 'who should I play?' is always 'whoever's numerically strongest'.
			That's a lot of rhetoric in one paragraph, but you get the idea. Like marksmen and juggernauts before them, mages are getting a class-wide update, drawing out their individual strengths and cranking them up to 11. If your favorite spellslinger didn't get directly changed, never fear - mage items have also been recalibrated to enable more diverse playstyles. Time will tell how impactful the changes are, but one thing's for sure: it's a good patch for folks that love ability power.
			Circling back, let's talk objectives. Current balance between mapwide objectives is pretty off-kilter, with turrets taking the lion's share of strategic value. Our goal with Midseason isn't just to spiffy up the jungle bosses and buffs, but to make contesting them a viable option when weighed against sieging or defending a turret. By diversifying the rewards on the map, we create an environment where teams constantly re-evaluate the importance of objectives as the game progresses. Between controlling, contesting, and trading, there's a lot to take (and a lot to take in), but adaptation is key to coming out on top.
			And that's all we have for today! Be sure to to check out the whole thing (it's a doozy) and we'll see you on the other side, Proto-Belting forward recklessly and drinking in the chaos. It's times like these where experimentation is best rewarded - just remember to credit us if Jungle Syndra really takes off.
			Good luck, have fun.

Mid-Patch Updates

	
		
			
				5/9/2016 Balance Update
			
			
			
				Even this early out of the gate, it's clear that a few of our mage updates have fallen into 'balance outlier' territory. We're making some mid-patch adjustments to help them make it to 6.10, when we can follow up with further changes if necessary.
			
		
	



	
		
			
            
                 Malzahar
            
			
				Malzahar is powering through both lane and jungle a bit too well. We're hitting the efficiency of his spells to slow his roll.
			
			
				Q - Call of the Void
			
			
				COST 60 mana ⇒ 80 mana

                 Cassiopeia
            
			
				Cassiopeia's update shaved a little too much power off of Twin Fang. Rather than raw damage buffs, we're giving back a bit of its uptime.
			
			
				E - Twin Fang
			
			
				COOLDOWN 0.9 seconds ⇒ 0.75 seconds
			
			
				COST 60/65/70/75/80 mana ⇒ 40/50/60/70/80 mana
			
			
				CAST RANGE 550 (from Cassiopeia's hitbox edge to her opponent's) ⇒ 700 (from Cassiopeia's hitbox center to her opponent's.) Overall, slight increase against small targets and slight decrease against large targets.
			
		
	


	
		
			
            
                 Vladimir
            
			
				Vladimir's having difficulty translating his early game strength into late game impact. A bit of love for his Q and E should help him scale out of lane and into teamfights.
			
			
				Q - Transfusion
			
			
				CRIMSON RUSH HEALING BONUS 2.5% missing health per 100 ability power ⇒ 4% missing health per 100 ability power

                 Swain
            
			
				We're upping Swain's rewards for good Decrepify plays to help offset the loss of reliability. Just as important: his ult's no longer bugged to stop him in his tracks mid-combo.
			
			
				Q - Decrepify
			
			
				DAMAGE 25/40/55/70/85 per second ⇒ 30/50/70/90/110 per second

                 Mordekaiser
            
			
				R - Children of the Grave
			
			
				BUGFIX Spawning a Dragon ghost no longer breaks the minimap's respawn timer (scoreboard timer was unaffected)
			
		
	


	
		
			
            
                 Deathfire Touch

									Vladimir
								
								
																	
								
									Kicking off the Mage update, Vladimir’s changes are all about embracing his love of sustain and pushing it to the extreme. While Vlad’s high-stakes health management is compelling, his lack of windows for interaction (don’t be in range of Q) leaves opponents far less enthused. This is where many of Vlad’s balancing issues stem from. If Vlad’s too strong, he stat-checks you out of the lane, nullifying your aggression and healing it all right back. Following the same vein, a weak Vlad does most of the opponent’s job for them - damaging himself constantly while desperately trying to scale into the lategame.
									Enter Midseason. To support Vladimir’s eccentric tastes, we’re looking to inject more interaction into the Crimson Reaper’s rotation. Vladimir’s swings are much more dramatic - larger health costs yield greater damage and healing, but also greater risk. Timing’s more important for Vlad as well: Crimson Rush’s cadence means Transfusion’s persistent threat goes down, while Tides of Blood’s new positional requirement can make or break a close-quarters encounter. We’re all for enabling Vlad’s indulgent, drain-tanking fantasy - provided he can survive long enough for his second wind to start the sustain train all over again.

									Malzahar
								
									
									
								
									Malzahar faces a constant dilemma: never use his abilities in lane or push constantly. This playstyle causes Malzahar to be very binary and non interactive; either he has enough AP to drop his spells on a wave and leave lane or he slowly pushes out, leaving him exposed to constant ganks. As well, the nature of his ultimate - cancelable by any CC - makes Malzahar’s power curve binary by necessity: you either stop his channel or somebody dies.
									In both cases, what Malzahar needs is leeway; a brief window of protection. Adding that window allows us to dial back on Malzahar’s burst and wave clear while giving him more sustained threat in a larger fight. Malz’s actions shouldn’t feel inevitable, but at least he’ll feel less bad about trying to make plays.
									He’ll still be the consistently damaging voidling master, but he should feel better about brawling near the frontlines when he brings more sustained cooldowns and a little bit of protection.

									Cassiopeia
								
									
									
								
									True to her half-snake nature, Cassiopeia bears twin identities of “poison mage” and “lightning-fast viper strikes.” However, the high-input gameplay of Twin Fang has left Cassiopeia wanting for greater impact in her poisons, instead viewing them as a gating condition for her combo damage.
									Rather than giving her more damaging poisons (Singed has that market cornered), we’ve sharpened Cassiopeia’s poison fantasy by linking Miasma to another snake fantasy: immobilization. The new Miasma lets Cassiopeia weaponize her own immobility by bringing opponents to her level. By limiting the ability of champions to leave her kill zone, Cassiopeia dictates the ranges of an engagement, keeping foes at a distance where she can wail on them safely. Should her opponents play around Miasma, however, Cassiopeia loses that control and faces swift punishment from the champions she sought to keep at bay.

									Zyra
								
									
									
								
									Zyra’s function as a zone-controlling plant mage has always been clear, but Midseason presented an opportunity to really let her playstyle bloom. Zyra’s plants are key to this zone-controlling strategy, but Rampant Growth’s seed-dispensing limitations have always left her wanting more. Zyra’s fantasy promises a sprawling landscape of minions to grow and do her bidding, but ends up as ‘grow two plants on a moderate cooldown that die pretty easily’.
									Now, Zyra doesn’t just plant a garden - she is the garden. Cultivating the ‘Rise of the Thorns’ into more than just a title, Zyra’s becoming a walking zone of threat, deploying seeds that grow into explosive teamfight potential the longer she’s in an area. Combining Stranglethorns’ plant-enhancing frenzy with more plants than ever before, Zyra’s reclaiming her strategic identity as the disengage pick, making would-be divers heed the warning to keep off the grass.

									Seeds spawn around Zyra periodically, becoming faster with level. If an enemy champion steps on a seed, it dies. If Zyra is hiding in brush, seeds will not spawn until she reveals herself. Casting Deadly Spines or Grasping Roots near seeds causes them to grow into Plants. Plants of the same type deal 50% less damage against the same target.

									Brand
								
									
									
								
									Brand's always been the guy who sets the world on fire with area damage and percent-health burns. Unfortunately for him, the proliferation of the percent-health mechanic in other spaces has robbed him of half of that identity. Even among mages, the Rylai's/Liandry's combo allows other champions to fill the same niche. This leaves Brand as a pretty generic source of damage, meaning he’s only picked when overtuned, rather than for any strategic purpose.
									We're updating Blaze to cement Brand's status as the go-to battle mage for AoE damage. No one punishes a team for clumping together like Brand: the new Blaze creates a volatile chain reaction as detonations stack Blaze onto all enemies caught in the blast, hastening their own detonations for even more explosive damage. Toss in a markedly more sadistic targeting system for Pyroclasm, and Brand becomes a true living inferno.

									Vel'Koz
								
									
									
								
									Vel'Koz has some cool things going for him - his research-and-destroy thematic, the combo playstyle of his passive, and his giant face laser to name a few. Problem is, there's no direction to these aspects. It makes little difference how or in what order Vel'Koz uses his abilities, so long as he hits them all to maximize his passive procs. Repeated bursts of true damage are good in any situation, so where does Vel’Koz shine?
									While some of our other mage updates overhaul the tools that define them, we're surgically adjusting Vel’Koz’s existing kit to accentuate his identity. Namely, Life Form Disintegration Ray's interaction with Organic Deconstruction has changed. Instead of quickly stacking his passive against anything in its path, Vel'Koz's laser now requires him to do his research first, paying off the investment with massive amounts of true damage. Where Organic Deconstruction stings, Disintegration Ray burns, making Vel'Koz is the artillery mage to pick when you need to melt through beefy tanks and fighters.

									One of our oldest champions, Anivia’s always been a power-pick for those willing to weather the storm of her steep mastery curve. While her strategic identity as a counter to heavy sieging is already strong, we saw an opportunity with Midseason to sharpen her traits as a disruptor even further. By focusing power into her already-potent CC, Anivia cements herself as a centerpiece for teams looking to seize control of the battlefield’s neutral ground.

									Annie
								
								
									Bears.
								
								
									Annie's simplicity as one of League’s original 40 belies a surprising amount of depth, but there are a few areas where her gameplay simply needs to be brought up to modern standards. The first is the lack of clarity around her stun. A skilled Annie learns to bypass Pyromania's indicator by sitting on three stacks, then burning Molten Shield to proc Pyromania as she throws out a near-instant stun. While this lends some degree of mastery to Annie's kit, it means a significant chunk of her power has been tied to outplaying the UI. Pyromania is now tracked on a resource bar and we’re moving that power elsewhere -- more on that later.
									The other half of Pyromania’s problem is actually Molten Shield, whose outdated design doesn’t offer enough for Annie to value it as anything other than a cheap Pyromania stack. Molten Shield is being modernized to a shorter, situationally powerful tool with clearer anti-burst uses against the likes of Zed ult, giving Annie a reason to feel good about it.
									Returning to the question of how we’re compensating Annie for losing her invisible stun, that power is being reallocated to Tibbers, the most unrealized aspect of Annie's fantasy as pyro girl with giant bear guardian. For being such an integral part of Annie’s character, Tibbers serves little purpose outside of a safer AoE spell than Incinerate for a flash-stun combo. We're putting some fury into Tibbers’ bear swipes and smartening up his AI to make him a persistent threat until killed, befitting his status as the infernal familiar Annie's always deserved.

									BURNING RAGE Using Pyromania on an enemy champion also causes Tibbers to enrage
								
								
									BEAR VENGEANCE If Annie dies while Tibbers is summoned, Tibbers instantly regenerates 50% of his missing health, enrages, and targets Annie’s killer. If Annie’s killer is too far away, Tibbers will focus the lowest health champion instead.
								
							
						
					
		        
		        
		        	
						
							
								
								
									Fiddlesticks
								
								
									Fiddlesticks is a special type of immobile: he actually has to stand still to use some of his abilities, leaving him slow to respond when team fights move away from him. By giving him the tools to go with the flow as the fight moves around, we’re sharpening his role as an explosive fight-starter, surprise party enthusiast, and spooky scary... scarecrow. This also gives us room to dial back on some of the more binary parts of Fiddle’s kit, like his long-ranged fear or his permadrain. The result is a more interactive Fiddlesticks who’s better able to position himself to make plays.

									Kennen
								
								
									Kennen's niche of \"dive the enemy team and stun kids\" is well-defined, but the randomness of who his ult zaps means his teamfighting impact is often left up to chance. Sometimes Slicing Maelstrom focus-fires a priority target on the far edge of its range, other times it ignores the squishy that Kennen’s right beside as they saunter off to safety. This can be just as frustrating for Kennen’s opponents; it all depends on who draws the short straw. We’re removing Slicing Maelstrom’s randomness to make it more consistent for both sides: Kennen will always stun enemies he’s allowed to stay close to, so it’s never a waste of resources to peel him off your backline.
									On a separate note, we cleaned up a few weird numbers in Kennen’s other abilities. Notably, Electrical Surge’s range was overly generous, so we’re trimming it to keep Kennen in harm’s way if he wants to jolt his enemies.

									Swain
								
								
									Despite his title, Swain’s largely failed to live up to his promise of a master tactician. Instead, Swain mains have come to embrace him as an unkillable teamfight-tanking monstrosity. Sometimes a champion having split identities can lead to balancing awkwardness (like Kalista, the solo outplay carry with insane teammate synergies), but Swain is more odd than problematic. Sure, ‘Commander Bird Monster’ is weird, but so is Shen being a tanky ninja. We’re not here to judge.
									Rather than force one identity over the other, we’re looking at ways to enhance Swain overall. Regardless of why you play the Master Tactician, he’s a tanky mage with DoT’s and that’s not changing. Instead, Swain’s updates are about using his abilities in the right situations to overcome the odds. Careful optimization and placement of his bread-and-butter spells gives Swain the room to tactically outpace the opposition before morphing into an even-more-Ravenous-Flock for the teamfight checkmate.

Syndra’s changes are light, but sharp: shifting power into the potential of Dark Spheres. By giving Syndra more influence through Spheres, we can reward her mastery of manipulation with masterful mid-fight CC combos.

									Veigar
								
								
									Veigar's potential to go infinite with Baleful Strike’s AP gain on kill is a good fit for his theme of “little ball of evil with an overcompensation problem,” but means Veigar should care more about farming pitiful minions than blasting down enemy champions. We're retooling the mechanic as Veigar's new passive and opening it up to reward the Tiny Master of Evil for constantly asserting dominance over his opponents. While examining how Veigar antagonizes his enemies, we also changed Primordial Burst to give him the pick of the litter when obliterating low health enemies. He’ll have to press more than one button to erase an enemy mage, but even the most durable tank should carefully consider their health bar before re-engaging.

									Viktor
								
								
									Despite sporting a kit full of unique teamfighting tools, most of Viktor’s gadgets have been historically kept on a tight leash due to the efficiency of Death Ray’s infamous Augment: Shockwave. Viktor should feel rewarded for setting his schemes into motion (like trapping multiple enemies in a Gravity Field), but the ability to follow up with instant target deletion puts the ball too far in his court. By shifting Viktor’s damage to be higher over-time, we can hit two birds with one stone. Opponents aren’t evaporated for making a single mistake, and Viktor gets to carry a fight through intelligent play like the diabolical mastermind he is.

									Xerath
								
								
									Rite of the Arcane sets up Xerath’s unique high point: a long-ranged barrage that forces opponents to dance. However, it was often Arcanopulse with its consistent poke that gave him his siege monster reputation. While Xerath should be able to effectively siege with his basic abilities, we also want his signature ability to be more impactful, giving players a reason to access its power more often and for longer. By dialing back a little on the inevitability of Arcanopulse and upping the impact of Rite of the Arcane, we’re giving Xerath more chances to succeed with his ultimate, ensuring higher highs for experienced ascendants.

									What would Ziggs do? The answer should almost always be “blow everything up,” but for an impulsive demolitionist, Ziggs spends a lot of time protecting turrets with his waveclear rather than knocking them down. Dialing back on his multi-lane wave clear lessens his ability to stall out games and drives more interactive gameplay with his opponents. In exchange, we’re giving the Hexplosives Expert the power to bring the boom to his enemies’ turrets, chunking them down with Short Fuse procs before hexploding them with Satchel Charge when they’re vulnerable. Let no turret be left standing!

				Mage Itemization
			
		
			
				
					
						League’s current mana and mana regen itemization is largely focused around stat efficiency: which item gives me the best ability to ignore my mana costs? This doesn’t lead to much in the way of playstyle differentiation, meaning mages have little flexibility to buy into different team strategies or respond to the conditions of a match as it progresses. We’re strengthening the identities of the mana items to give mages better tools to alter the way they play.
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Tear of the Goddess
					
					
						Refunds a portion of mana spent.
					
					
						Tear of the Goddess creates an odd conflict: it’s the mage item which gives the most raw mana (attractive to champions with high mana costs), but it has to be stacked up by constantly casting spells (something champions with high mana costs can’t afford to do). As such, it tends to be picked up by champions who can spam spells, making them effectively manaless as it stacks.We’re changing Tear’s pure regen to a mana refund, opening it up to high-mana cost champions, not just a select few spammers.

We’re making Catalyst the item for constant mage brawlers who want to shoot first, shoot later, and then shoot some more, allowing them to make full use of their skirmishing tendencies.

						Chalice of Harmony
					
					
						Restores health or mana, whichever is at a lower percent.
					
					
						Chalice is the go-to pick for champions who can easily clear waves, leading to a non-interactive lane phase as they spam their skills to keep the minions fighting at a safe distance. The new Chalice is still oriented at lane sustain, but in a way that encourages taking the occasional risk. If your health dips, Chalice will switch to healing you back up, ensuring you’ve got access to whichever regen effect you need most to dig your heels in for the long haul.
						As a quick point of differentiation: while the new Catalyst rewards champions while they fight, Chalice lets them stay in lane after trades, making it ideal for champions who fall on the more ‘opportunistic’ side of the spectrum.

These days, however, the identity of ‘big stat stick’ has lost meaning as items have evolved to serve more unique strategic purposes. The new Rod of Ages takes cues from Catalyst of Aeons: ride the efficiency of an early stat payoff (and a head start on your second item) to secure dominance over your enemies before they’ve built into more specialized item choices.

						For the duration of their existences, Morellonomicon and Athene’s Unholy Grail have had significant overlap, sharing three stats, two component items, and the same distinction of offensive mage items with best-in-slot mana regen. While they go about defining ‘offense’ in different ways - Morellonomicon makes it easier to secure kills while Athene’s gives you the mana to go for more kills - these two items just aren’t meaningfully different from one another.
						Since we’re creating a split between mana and mana regen items, we’re taking the opportunity to split Morellonomicon and Athene’s as well. Morellonomicon is fully embracing its identity as an aggressive mage item, going so far as to absorb the old ‘mana resets’ passive of its former sibling Athene’s on top of its hallmark Grievous Wounds.

						Athene’s Unholy Grail has taken on a new role as a team sustain item for aggressive supports (and off-supports) like Lulu, Morgana, and Karma. These enchantresses naturally alternate between directly engaging in combat and protecting their team; Athene’s rewards them for striking an optimal balance by granting them a bit of persistent sustain that most lack.

						Aura now scales with level and no longer affects minions. Now grants cooldown reduction.
					
					
						In a mage-vs-mage matchup, the winner often comes down to who finishes Abyssal Scepter first. Its 30 ability power bump on completion synergizes with its magic resist reduction aura to create a huge combat advantage upon completion. If that weren’t enough, the aura also makes it much easier to push minion waves into the enemy turret, denying opponents the gold necessary to finish their own Scepter. We’re repositioning Abyssal Scepter to play up its defensive aspects, while tuning its aura to be less oppressive in lane but more relevant in the late game.

						Zhonya’s Hourglass struggles to maintain two very expensive characteristics: it’s a top-tier ability power item that also boasts one of the strongest actives in the game. Historically, this duality has forced us to lock Zhonya’s behind a steep price tag or awkward build path - usually both. There are other items which offer tons of ability power, but no other item shares Zhonya’s’ active, so we’re going all-in on its identity as a defensive utility item. That decision has allowed us to drop the price of Zhonya’s to the lowest it’s ever been in League history, making it more readily available in times its stasis effect is truly needed.

				Hextech Items
			
		
			
				
					
					
						Hextech Revolver
					
					
						No longer gives spell vamp. Now adds bonus damage to basic attacks.
					
					
						Heading into our upgraded Hextech weaponry prompts an important question: why is all the spell vamp gone?
						Let’s start by comparing it to lifesteal. Thematically, lifesteal gives the feeling that you’re fighting back against death, creating tense 1 on 1 duels with uncertain outcomes. Mechanically, lifesteal says ‘I may have a small health bar but you’ve got to focus me down or I’ll regenerate to full.’ Spell vamp, while sounding similar, doesn’t quite hit the same bar. Unlike basic attacks, no two abilities are the same, which makes the stat wildly variable in value.
						This means that it’s functionally impossible to make spell vamp work the way you’d expect, and it instead operates on myriad edge-cases to avoid feeling abusive and unintuitive. Cut to today’s world where it’s only used on Vladimir (whose balance is kept lock-step with the stat), it’s easy to see why it had to go.
						So why buy into Hextech? Revolver (and its upgrades) are all about benefitting the mid-range mages that have to scrap to survive. Like Catalyst for sustain or Tear for becoming a late-game monster, Revolver represents a commitment to securing advantages through combat. While everyone’s waiting to power-up, Hextech provides the power spike you need to get the snowball rolling.

						Hextech GLP-800
					
					
						Activate to spray enemies with icy bolts and slow them.
					
					
						While back-line artillery or shield-heavy utility mages can load up on ability power in whatever combination to get by (thanks to range or mitigation), mages that get up close and personal are forced to buy whatever will give them the stats to survive combat. Following in Revolver’s footsteps, Hextech remedies this situation by saying ‘If you have to be in the middle of a fight, you should have the extra firepower to customize how your encounters play out’.
						Enter the GLP-800. Targeted at CC-heavy mages that like to skirmish, GLP provides an extra spell cooldown and source of damage that allows you more in-fight flexibility. Need to peel an ally from a pesky diver? GLP’s got that. Worried you can’t land your combo? GLP can let you hit-confirm your CC and lock opponents down for good. You can even waveclear with it in a pinch! Whatever your particular in-fight need is, the GLP-800’s got your back to enable the beefier mages out there with the tools to get the job done.

						Activate to dash forward and let loose a volley of fiery bolts.
					
					
						Where the GLP-800 is all about controlling distance via CC, the Hextech Protobelt’s all about picking the right moment for a daring maneuver. Whether you’re extending the effective range of a Flash Tibbers stun or dodging a crucial skillshot, Protobelt improves playmaking potential for those quick-witted enough to use its active. It’s not all sunshine and dash-extensions however; Hextech’s actives all share a cooldown, and Protobelt’s the least efficient in a six-item build. This means you’ll need to make every Fire Bolt count, and hopefully close out the game before it becomes obsolete.

Instead of rocking the boat, we tied it to a lightning mechanic (and made the active match) so it plays nice with the other Hextech upgrades. If you’re looking for pure, hybrid offense - look no further.

						Elemental Dragons
					
					
						Dragon has now been replaced by four Elemental Drakes. Slaying each provides your team with a powerful permanent bonus that stacks on multiple kills of the same type.
					
					
						Ever since launch, Dragon’s been an iconic objective to control in League. Whether it gives buffs or gold (or that time it spawned before minions did), Dragon’s purpose is to give people something to take risks and make decisions around. Fast forward to today, and while Dragon’s certainly very cool, it has its share of problems.
						First, the static value of Dragon’s stacks allows you to answer the question of ‘Which stacks do I want and when?’ long before you ever have to make the decision to fight for them. This devalues individual Dragon spawns - why rush the 1st stack now when you can just get it later? Furthermore, denying at least one stack virtually removes the threat of Aspect of the Dragon's game-ending power, making it more of a pipe dream than a path to victory.
						Our goal is to raise the cap on strategic mastery when it comes to playing around Dragon. With the advent of the Elementals, your ability to adapt on the fly becomes much more important. Questions change from a pre-solved ‘How much do we care about 1st stack, 2nd stack, etc?' to a situational ‘How much do we care about each element right now?’ Trading and denying become much more important (and realistic) possibilities as well - making sure the split-push team from hell doesn’t get access to the Mountain Drake’s turret-taking buff, while the Cloud Drake’s movement speed buff could be what you need to out-rotate them. Navigating these situations will take time to get used to, but pushes the dragon conversation to one of constantly shifting values instead of how much a certain stack is worth.

						Elder Dragon
					
					
						Grants a powerful burn-over-time on spells and attacks. Increases the strength of your Elemental Drake buffs.
					
					
						Previously, Aspect of the Dragon was a powerful closing tool - assuming the game ever hit a point where you could get it. Part of the promise of Elemental Dragons is that no matter which spawn in what order, controlling them is always valuable for you in the long run. Elder Dragon lets us kill two birds with one buff - cashing in on your hard-earned stacks and ensuring that both teams can leverage its strength (or steal it) to close out a game in style.
					
					
						DRAGON TYRANT After 35 minutes, Elemental Dragons will no longer spawn. In their place, the Elder Dragon will spawn every 10 minutes.

						Rift Herald
					
					
						Now only spawns once. Rift Herald’s buff lasts an incredibly long time, persists through death, and provides amazing dueling power.
					
					
						Now that Rift Herald’s been out for nearly half a year, it’s time to reevaluate our goals. Originally added to introduce a new dynamic between both halves of the Rift, Herald hasn’t quite made the splash we hoped for. Instead of driving action to the top side of the map, the Doom's Eve buff comes with too many conditions to be universally appreciated. Do I take this before or after taking a turret? Do I take it instead of a turret? When you trade lane pressure to take something that gives lane pressure, things get pretty muddy.
						That brings us to today. When optimized, junglers solo Rift Herald with very little help or notice from their team and power farm camps until it’s time to group. This wouldn’t matter much, except that no one seems to care about taking it. ‘Are they bot? Eh, we’ll take a Herald I guess.’ Even after RH falls, there's no clear game impact - someone’s just ambiguously stronger for a short period of time. With Midseason incoming and an objective falling short of strategic significance, we went back to the drawing board.
						With 6.9, we’re eliminating the confusion and refocusing Rift Herald to be an objective you really don’t want to give away for free. Enabling snowballing and split-pushers alike, Herald is a one-time event that puts the team it falls to firmly in the driver’s seat for the early stages of the game.

						Jungle Timers
					
					
						Camps with timers indicate to both teams when they're close to respawning, via timers and the minimap.
					
					
						We want to facilitate more engaging objective play. A big part of accomplishing that is making them more worth contesting, but we also want them to be more contestable, especially in games that are at a standstill. Clearly communicating respawn timers will facilitate more buff steal plays and objective fights, particularly in mid-late game.

				Turrets
			
		
			
				
					
						Turret Stats
					
					
						Turrets are more durable, outer & inner turrets are more threatening, mages and assassins are better able to damage turrets.
					
					
						As players have gotten better at diving turrets, the structures have ceased to be defensible locations where teams can make a stand. We want to tone back on the perception of turrets as eventual sources of gold and instead let players feel good about defending the outermost reaches of their base (especially early game). Aggressive dives to punish laner mistakes should still be a part of the game, but we're balancing out the risk/reward distribution.
						On the other hand, we want more champions than just marksmen to interact with the turret killing game. We’re rebudgeting turret defenses so that other champions will feel better about their ability to play demolitionist.
					
					
						Outer & inner turret damage
					
					
						HEATING UP Turret damage increases by 37.5% for the second and third shots against champions, then 25% for the following two against a single champion (resets on target change) ⇒ 40% for the first three shots

						Turret Rewards
					
					
						Team gold rewards reduced.
					
					
						The previous section covered our general thoughts on turrets, so we'll keep this short. Team gold rewards for outer and inner turret kills are too high compared to the payoff for anything else teams can invest in during the early game. While we've got changes to make the \"anything else\" more attractive (see: everything in the Jungle Bosses category), we want to make it clear that turrets are just one piece of the overall objective puzzle.

				Game Pacing
			
		
			
				
					
						Jungle Experience
					
					
						Monsters grant more experience to junglers but less to non-junglers.
					
					
						The tactic of a solo player abandoning lane to farm monster camps with their jungler (we call it 'buddy jungling') evolved in response to the 2v1 lane swap. Rather than sit under tower, zoned out of experience, top laners ditch their lanes for safer prospects. Buddy jungling is enabled by the 'comeback' mechanic, which increases monster experience for lower-level champions. Though the jungler and top laner are both constantly underleveled due to splitting camps, comeback experience softens the punishment by adding net experience versus a solo clear.
						The casualty of this technique is the early game itself: buddy jungling puts eight of the ten players on the Rift into a pure PvE situation. That leads to an incredibly stale opening phase of the match and eliminates the lane dynamics many of League’s early-game champs (Renekton!) rely on to make their impact.
						We're putting a damper on buddy jungling by removing the experience efficiency granted to the buddy. That’s not to say it isn’t still situationally viable - having two people in the jungle can offer strategic value - we’re just ensuring it’s a careful decision rather than default behavior.
					
					
						ONLY FOR THE WORTHY Non-epic jungle monsters now only grant experience to their killers
					
					
						removedCATCH-UP Jungle monster experience rewards no longer increase when you’re lower level than the slain monster
					
					
						newFARM RAZORBEAKS All Jungle items now grant 30 bonus experience on monster kill for each level higher the monster is than you
					
					
						TIER 1 JUNGLE ITEMS Hunter’s Machete and Hunter’s Talisman grant 15 ⇒ 50 bonus experience on large monster kill
					
					
						TIER 2 JUNGLE ITEMS Stalker’s Blade, Skirmisher’s Sabre, and Tracker’s Knife grant 30 ⇒ 50 bonus experience on large monster kill
					
					
						HUNTING GROUND Based on the above changes, total jungle experience rewards have been adjusted. Overall, junglers now get slightly more experience per clear while non-junglers get slightly less.
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Death Timers
					
					
						Death timers reduced between 20-35 minutes.
					
					
						We last checked in on death timers back in 6.7, shortening them in the 30-55 minute time frame. Results look positive, so we’re making another small nudge.
					
					
						CAN I LIVE? Death timers slightly reduced around the 20-35 minute window
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Homeguard
					
					
						Homeguard duration and speed reduced, particularly early on.
					
					
						Back in preseason we baked Homeguard into the standard Summoner’s Rift experience for two purposes: to create better boot enchantment diversity and to counter-balance increases to death timers. More on boot enchantments later in these patch notes, but let’s talk about Homeguard’s coexistence with death timers.
						Time spent dead creates a window of safety for teams to act, knowing that dead enemies are gray-screened in the fountain. On revival, Homeguard catapults champions out of base and into position to counter enemy sieges or rotations. Aside from just getting somewhere faster, the haste adds flexibility: if the enemy team appears bot as you’re heading top, Homeguard allows you to adjust before too much damage is done.
						That flexibility creates a stalling effect as death timers tick down: “Can we take this turret before the enemy zooms in and dives our backline?” That unease shortens the window of safety to act, magnifying the effect of actual death timer reductions: 2 seconds off a 30 second death timer is actually 2 seconds off a ~25 second window. This is particularly true at earlier stages of the game, thanks to Homeguard’s static effects.
						So, after leaving things untouched back in 6.7, we’re now toning Homeguard’s haste down to account for both rounds of death timer reductions and scaling it with game time to ensure its impact doesn’t choke out early aggression.

						Azir
					
					
						R no longer pins targets to walls
					
					
						The flashy playmaking nature of Azir's ult befits his status as ruler of an empire, but Emperor's Divide becomes oppressive when it pins enemies against terrain for 5+ seconds. We're removing the abuse case to keep Azir honest.

						Illaoi
					
					
						Vessel debuff greatly shortened, but spawns tentacles faster.
					
					
						Despite being Illaoi’s most interesting ability, Test of Spirit mostly ends up testing the patience of those involved. Being tested forces a tough choice onto Illaoi’s opponents, telling them fight or suffer the consequences. This choice is usually a trap - fighting Illaoi in close quarters is a death sentence given her massive area damage. Escaping the zone means slogging through waves of tentacles, which isn’t much better most of the time.
						On Illaoi’s side, turning someone into a vessel is really only a consideration for the laning phase. Once you’re testing spirits in teamfights, the minute-long debuff rarely matters. We want all participants of the Test to feel like they’re getting a fair shake, so we’re shifting around some mechanics to compress what it means to be a vessel. Illaoi gets to pressure opponents in a way that’s meaningful in teamfights (her forte), but her victims don’t have to deal with her lectures for an eternity.

						Q cooldown up while in Wolf’s Frenzy. W lasts longer and deals bonus damage to monsters.
					
					
						Let’s call a wolf a wolf - Kindred’s early game is out of line. We want Kindred to be able to pressure the map (especially through expert control of their Marks), but invading top-tier duelists with impunity is pushing it. We’re adjusting their clearing ability to stay roughly the same, but Kindred will need to pick their battles a little more carefully if they want to start scaling out of control.

						Rengar
					
					
						E no longer flies in random directions.
					
					
						These are mostly bugfixes, with the exception of Bola Strike. Previously, Bola Strike would always try to fire at the location Rengar targeted once its cast delay completed. When targeting distant points, Rengar's movement (ex. a jump strike out of ult) during Bola Strike's short cast time wouldn't change much. When targeting a nearby spot, however, Rengar could suddenly end up in front of the target location he had previously been behind. Bola Strike would then fire in the complete opposite direction it was cast. We're changing Bola Strike's targeting system to fix that unreliability.

						Soraka
					
					
						Q slow and movement speed down. No longer refreshes Windspeaker’s.
					
					
						Soraka’s changes are all about injecting more risk when she wades into the fray to provide assistance. For a champion that already pumps out amazing heals, the strength of Soraka’s kiting doubles up on denying any sort of aggression that comes her way. By cutting down on Starcall’s over-the-top protective tools, Soraka becomes less of a one-stop-shop for protection without losing the healing potential she’s picked for.
						Lastly, a quick note on Rejuvenation’s on interaction with Windspeaker’s Blessing. Windspeaker’s was made in a world without any healing over time effects - and as such, wasn’t really balanced around high uptimes. Enter Soraka’s Rejuvenation mechanic back in 6.5 and now she’s tossing around 6-8 second armor and magic resist buffs off of a single spellcast. It’s possible that we revisit this mechanic and work on clearly defined rules about how HoT’s (and other heals) should interact with Windspeakers, but for now we’re not comfortable with the amount of strength it’s adding to a single champion.

						Taric
					
					
						Base mana up, mana growth down. W range down. E is shorter and narrower.
					
					
						An old champion with a new coat of gems, Taric’s tearing up the battlefield while keeping his teammates spotless. A protector in the truest sense, the issue of Taric’s current power level isn’t how well he saves his allies - but rather the considerable range at which he’s able to influence the fight. This doesn’t come up much in lane (as Taric’s usually next to his bastion-buddy), but once ganks and teamfights start entering the picture things get messy. We’re trimming Taric’s excess power and focusing him around being the dependable shield you carry with you to a fight, committing him to stick close to his team if he wants to have the same impact.

						Teemo
					
					
						More traps.
					
					
						Alright. We know people are going to come into this section thinking ‘Why buff Teemo?’, but let’s be honest with ourselves. While Teemo’s always been a serviceable laner, the Swift Scout has been on the weaker side of the spectrum for a long while. The root causes are many, but we’re targeting two: Teemo’s awkward mana usage, and his inability to set up the mushroom fields he’s known for.
						Getting into specifics, Teemo players find themselves opting into sometimes ranking up W - Move Quick not because it’s particularly good, but so the costs of his other spells don’t go through the roof. Similarly, a Teemo that’s behind is pressured against laying traps due to their high cost and cooldown, making them lackluster when the enemy team’s already gaining control of the map. Releasing the mana pressures across Teemo’s kit allows him to spend more time thinking critically about when and where to use his abilities.

						Revives faster at higher levels.
					
					
						Most tanks have been excited to jump into the fray in 2016, but Zac’s been unexpectedly absent. Zac’s already best-in-class when it comes to getting into sticky situations, but Cell Divison shifts dramatically from an early-game boon to a limp extended late-game death. Considering long-range initiation is kind of Zac’s thing, the fact that he tends to land in risky situations shouldn’t feel as punishing as it does later on. We’re tweaking the Secret Weapon’s specs to help him maneuver the backlines and to give him a fighting chance of bouncing back into action (should his team provide the necessary assistance).

						Boot Enchantments
					
					
						With Homeguard no longer being tied to the enchantment system, almost all of the remaining options are very broad bonuses to movement. As seen earlier this season, bonus movement speed is a dangerous thing to stack, with boot enchants being a major contributor. When considering how warping Alacrity’s been toward introducing movement speed into the item system (and how potentially warping Captain or Fervor can be), we’re pulling the system to put a tighter leash on the ways champions can gain extra speed.
						It’s possible that we’ll revisit the concept of boot enchants in the future, but only after we find ways for it help dodge mobility creep - not enforce it.

						Enchantment: Devourer
					
					
						Goodbye, Ghost Dog.
					
					
						For years we’ve tried to provide junglers an item that helps them burn through the jungle, but despite multiple seasons of iteration we’ve failed to find an incarnation of ‘stacking jungle rewards’ that wasn’t problematic. While Devourer is an incremental improvement over past incarnations (shout-outs to those who remember Feral Flare’s insane healing and vision control), the primary problem with ‘farming junglers’ is that you don’t see them for half the game. Junglers are an integral part of how teams in League operate, and incentivizing them to AFK for the 15 minutes is too high a cost to be healthy long-term. We still want to support junglers that like high attack speed and on-hit builds, but this isn’t the way to do it.
					
					
						removedFINALLY SATED Enchantment: Devourer has been removed from the shop
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					new?
					
						Enchantment: Bloodrazor
					
					
						Everything old is new again.
					
					
						Bloodrazor’s back from its years of traveling the world to be the jungle item we deserve. Attack speed junglers break down into different audiences, and Bloodrazor caters to both. Tankier on-hit champions (like Shyvana and Warwick) will find it an appropriate centerpiece to their natural synergies, while Kindred and Master Yi can pair it with Blade of the Ruined King and armor penetration for scaling builds.
						The removal of Devourer and the inclusion of Bloodrazor means that junglers will feel better about jumping directly into battle after finishing their item rather than waiting for it to power up. There will always be junglers who prioritize farming, and there will always be junglers that will rarely gank your lane - the key is that these decisions will be up to the player and their champion’s kits, not forced by the items they buy into.

						Guinsoo's Rageblade
					
					
						Upgraded to an end-game item. Now has Sated Devourer’s Phantom Hit passive.

					
					
						We couldn’t have a section with Devourer without addressing Guinsoo’s Rageblade as well. Rageblade’s a controversial item on live, but we’re convinced it feels far more overbearing than it actually is. Its power blooms specifically in the hands of basic-attack focused champions looking to snowball a lead, versus being generically too powerful. Even when it’s played on other champions (shout-outs to Tristana), it’s to fill a specific early-game niche.
						That said, a large part of Guinsoo’s balance depends on it being kept behind a few really unsatisfying barriers. For instance, it has the worst build path in the game - creating a low point of power as you struggle to accumulate its exorbitant combine cost. On the flip side, finishing Rageblade spikes you far harder than most items at that price point, creating a race to keep Rageblade users down before they can become relevant. When the correct play against Rageblade is ‘snowball incredibly hard or lose,’ we can do better.
						Our solution is to upgrade Guinsoo’s into a top-tier endgame item for the champions who value hybrid stats and on-hit builds. This allows for a more steady progression of power, as well as allowing us to put the much-coveted ‘Phantom Hit’ passive within arm’s reach of non-junglers. We’ll let you think of some of the more powerful combos (Aatrox?), but rewarding champions with access to top-shelf on-hit insanity once they’ve committed to combat feels like an appropriate gate for skirmishers and divers alike.

						The Black Cleaver
					
					
						Cost reduced. -5 AD.
					
					
						For those keeping up with recent top lane trends, builds have skewed toward the tankier end for the majority of 2016. Black Cleaver is a natural ‘release valve’ to help counter these champions, providing necessary shred and sticking power to run down even the beefiest defenders. When we noticed that its primary users (Renekton, Gnar, Riven to name a few) weren’t in the best spot performance wise, it made sense to bring the item that binds them together down to the price-points of other important powerspikes.

						Spectre's Cowl
					
					
						Costs more. More health, less magic resist.
					
					
						After reshaping and reinforcing the equipment mages have at their disposal, it stands to reason that we’d bolster the options to defend against them as well. Maw and Abyssal Scepter are solid purchases for the damage-minded, but the marquee tank options of the magic resist family need some work.
						All of that begins with Spectre’s Cowl. Funnily enough, Cowl actually has the opposite problem of its upgrades - it’s too efficient for its cost, to the point that tanks are often happy leaving it un-upgraded far into the game. We want them to feel good about sitting on Cowl in lane, but tinkering with its efficiency should pressure tanks into spending more gold to get their desired magical defenses.

						Banshee's Veil
					
					
						Health and cost down. Recipe changed.
					
					
						Banshee’s Veil offers an entirely unique effect in the item lineup, but its similar  price-point and statline to Spirit Visage do more harm than good for BV’s chances of actually being purchased.  Normally too expensive compared to its cousin, we’re shrinking Veil to be the earlier buy that guards against a burst mage gone wild, with an accordingly slimmer stat line. This makes it less effective in a full item build if you’re aiming for pure defense, but more accessible for those in need of a spell shield on a budget.

						Spirit Visage
					
					
						Combine cost and magic resist down. Regen and healing up.
					
					
						On the other side of the Spectre’s Cowl, Spirit Visage is a popular pick-up that’s purchased for its pure protective stats. To differentiate it from Veil’s more immediate benefits, we’re pushing Spirit Visage to more comfortably fit within final builds by emphasizing its synergies with other tank items (like Warmog’s).

						Quicksilver Sash & Mercurial Scimitar
					
					
						Active now only removes crowd control debuffs.
					
					
						The QSS and Mercurial Scimitar active has two uses: cleansing crowd control (Amumu ult) and purging combat debuffs (Zed ult). These cases differ in that crowd control is setup, while combat debuffs are the payoffs to such setup. When you cleanse CC, the enemy needs to lock you down again to aggress on you, but that tends to be a pretty reasonable ask. By contrast, cleansing a combat debuff wipes the applicator's primary means of fighting you. So, those champs are pressured to snowball before their effects become meaningless, while their opponents are forced into buying QSS even if it's incredibly inefficient to do so. This leads to destructive effects on game balance which we've left unanswered for too long. With the understanding that there may be outliers we need to address, we're unshackling combat debuff champs from their quicksilver collars.

						Hexdrinker, Maw of Malmortius & Sterak’s Gage
					
					
						Sterak’s Gage and Maw of Malmortius shields no longer stack. Sterak’s Fury and Lifegrip now both proc when Lifeline is triggered.
					
					
						Maw and Sterak’s have complementary defensive triggers: Maw cares about how low you are while Sterak’s cares about how fast you’re dropping. This presents an interesting choice in lane: which item is best for the situation you’re in? Unfortunately, that choice becomes meaningless as the game progresses and beefy champs stack both items to cover all their bases. We’re tying the shields of Maw and Sterak’s together to ensure that picking one is a choice, not just the earlier of two purchases.
					
					
						WELCOME TO THE FAMILY Sterak’s Gage’s shield is now classified as a Lifeline effect along with the shields from Hexdrinker and Maw of Malmortius

						Bami's Cinder
					
					
						Health down.
					
					
						Compared to Giant’s Belt, Bami’s Cinder provides everything you want and more out of a defensive component. Given that it’s already got the offensive edge, we’re pulling back on Cinder’s efficiency so it’s not always a no-brainer.
					
					
						HEALTH 300 ⇒ 280
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Sunfire Cape
					
					
						Cost up.
					
					
						Similar to Bami’s Cinder, Sunfire’s efficient stats and hybrid offense/defense means it’s just the best early buy in most cases. Nudging it back to the price point of the other big Health/Armor makes it easier to pick the one for the right situation, not just whichever’s the cheapest.

						Enchantment: Cinderhulk
					
					
						Aura scales better with levels.
					
					
						For an item meant to help tanks scale into the lategame, Cinderhulk’s been all but forgotten next to the shiny base damage of Runic Echoes. With Cinderhulk’s intended role as an investment toward a tank’s endgame statline, it didn’t make much sense for it to end up weaker than Sunfire Cape’s aura (considering they don’t stack). We’re fixing things to break even with old Cinderhulk at level 6, around when most junglers are completing it anyways.

						Less health, but regenerates health while out of combat.
					
					
						Yes, this is technically a Jhin buff.
						With their rise in popularity (ever since Stealth Wards sold out), the prevalence of Vision Wards has highlighted how cumbersome it is to clear them out. In keeping with the themes of Midseason, we’re easing the burden of cutting down successive pinks while making them more valuable to defend. Vision Wards have always been a mini-objective, so now we’re formalizing it.

						When it comes to diversity of Trinkets, Farsight’s been on top of the vision-throne for long while. Come mid-game, stacking Farsight trinkets changes the vision game drastically - rendering certain strategies revolving around making picks or ambushing virtually obsolete. We’re happy that Farsight’s more flexible in a wider number of vision-control strategies, we’re just adjusting so it’s not also crowding out the space entirely.

						Righteous Glory
					
					
						No longer speeds up allies. Active speed amount and duration increased. 
					
					
						In its current incarnation, Righteous Glory presents us with a few balancing troubles. When it’s too strong, it replaces traditional initiation and warps the environment to be ‘who are the best carriers of Righteous Glory and why aren’t you playing them?’ We’re removing that consideration altogether and really pushing its synergies with individual champions. It’ll be easier than ever for Righteous Glory users to run down fleeing targets, but they'll need more clever coordination than just ‘run as 5 in a straight line’ to start off a chaotic brawl.

						Health slightly reduced, now grants cooldown reduction.
					
					
						Despite its game-changing out-of-combat regeneration, Warmog’s Armor struggles to find a spot in builds for tanks and juggernauts alike. It’s not that the item’s subpar, but it simply doesn’t fit what most champions in these classes really need out of a gold investment. Tossing in a Kindlegem should help Warmog’s feel comparable to say, Spirit Visage when planning out your needs in a 6-item build.

The botlane meta’s always lived between the extremes of being an all-in lane with low tolerance for mistakes and a sustaining paradise where poke and attrition mean very little. The pendulum’s a little too far on the ‘poke matters less’ part of that spectrum, so we’re toning back sustain from some of the more common purchases.

				Skin Clarity Updates
			
		
			
				
					
						Like our recent work on Underworld Twisted Fate, we're revisiting eight skins whose VFX were pretty far below clarity standards. (Fun fact: all eight skins were disabled in competitive play.) Skins should be fun, alternative fantasies, not competitive advantages, so we're bringing their visual effects up to par.
					
					Ravenborn LeBlanc’s launch pads for W - Distortion are brighter and slightly larger
						Cosmic Reaver Kassadin’s Q - Null Sphere projectile is larger. Added a ring element for E- Force Pulse’s ready state.
						
						Headhunter Caitlyn’s Passive - Headshot now has glow particles on her hands when ready (in addition to the ones on her gun)
						
						Lunar Revel Caitlyn’s basic attack is now less noisy and aligns more with her base
						
						Blood Moon Elise’s E - Cocoon looks more like a cocoon, as opposed to Ahri's Charm. W - Skittering Frenzy has been cleaned up and now leaves the screen faster and is less noisy.
						
						Firecracker Jinx’s Q- Fishbones explosions have been cleaned up and have less smoke effects
						
						Forecast Janna’s Q - Howling Gale has been lightened for better visibility
						
						Dark Valkyrie Diana’s Q - Crescent Strike particle has been modified to make the brights brighter and darks darker

						Quinn no longer fails to proc Passive - Harrier when attacking a marked target immediately after canceling an attack
						
						Oracle Alteration now indicates its sweep range when hovered

			Greetings, summoners.
			Welcome to patch 6.9, the one where it's Midseason. You may notice the sweet new layout (if you're reading this in the patcher, we recommend heading to the web) - that's because this ain't your ordinary run-of-the-mill patch!
			Midseason is a time for us to reflect on what parts of Preseason worked and what didn't, and take large strides to keep League fresh. We identified two areas of improvement for Midseason: adding cohesion to the mage class, and shaking up the strategy surrounding objectives. Let's dive in.
			While thematically strong (who doesn't like casting spells?), mages have historically lacked a cohesive identity beyond 'damage that's magic.' Some are long-ranged, some are short-ranged, some are Fiddlesticks, you get the idea. A lack of clear expectations combined with the sheer size of the class means there's a lot of redundancy across the mage roster. In the end, this puts mages in a spot where the answer to 'who should I play?' is always 'whoever's numerically strongest'.
			That's a lot of rhetoric in one paragraph, but you get the idea. Like marksmen and juggernauts before them, mages are getting a class-wide update, drawing out their individual strengths and cranking them up to 11. If your favorite spellslinger didn't get directly changed, never fear - mage items have also been recalibrated to enable more diverse playstyles. Time will tell how impactful the changes are, but one thing's for sure: it's a good patch for folks that love ability power.
			Circling back, let's talk objectives. Current balance between mapwide objectives is pretty off-kilter, with turrets taking the lion's share of strategic value. Our goal with Midseason isn't just to spiffy up the jungle bosses and buffs, but to make contesting them a viable option when weighed against sieging or defending a turret. By diversifying the rewards on the map, we create an environment where teams constantly re-evaluate the importance of objectives as the game progresses. Between controlling, contesting, and trading, there's a lot to take (and a lot to take in), but adaptation is key to coming out on top.
			And that's all we have for today! Be sure to to check out the whole thing (it's a doozy) and we'll see you on the other side, Proto-Belting forward recklessly and drinking in the chaos. It's times like these where experimentation is best rewarded - just remember to credit us if Jungle Syndra really takes off.
			Good luck, have fun.

Mid-Patch Updates

	
		
			
				5/9/2016 Balance Update
			
			
			
				Even this early out of the gate, it's clear that a few of our mage updates have fallen into 'balance outlier' territory. We're making some mid-patch adjustments to help them make it to 6.10, when we can follow up with further changes if necessary.
			
		
	



	
		
			
            
                 Malzahar
            
			
				Malzahar is powering through both lane and jungle a bit too well. We're hitting the efficiency of his spells to slow his roll.
			
			
				Q - Call of the Void
			
			
				COST 60 mana ⇒ 80 mana

                 Cassiopeia
            
			
				Cassiopeia's update shaved a little too much power off of Twin Fang. Rather than raw damage buffs, we're giving back a bit of its uptime.
			
			
				E - Twin Fang
			
			
				COOLDOWN 0.9 seconds ⇒ 0.75 seconds
			
			
				COST 60/65/70/75/80 mana ⇒ 40/50/60/70/80 mana

                 Vladimir
            
			
				Vladimir's having difficulty translating his early game strength into late game impact. A bit of love for his Q and E should help him scale out of lane and into teamfights.

                 Swain
            
			
				We're upping Swain's rewards for good Decrepify plays to help offset the loss of reliability. Just as important: his ult's no longer bugged to stop him in his tracks mid-combo.

				DAMAGE 25/40/55/70/85 per second ⇒ 30/50/70/90/110 per second

                 Mordekaiser
            
			
				R - Children of the Grave
			
			
				BUGFIX Spawning a Dragon ghost no longer breaks the minimap's respawn timer (scoreboard timer was unaffected)
			
		
	


	
		
			
            
                 Deathfire Touch

									Vladimir
								
								
																	
								
									Kicking off the Mage update, Vladimir’s changes are all about embracing his love of sustain and pushing it to the extreme. While Vlad’s high-stakes health management is compelling, his lack of windows for interaction (don’t be in range of Q) leaves opponents far less enthused. This is where many of Vlad’s balancing issues stem from. If Vlad’s too strong, he stat-checks you out of the lane, nullifying your aggression and healing it all right back. Following the same vein, a weak Vlad does most of the opponent’s job for them - damaging himself constantly while desperately trying to scale into the lategame.
									Enter Midseason. To support Vladimir’s eccentric tastes, we’re looking to inject more interaction into the Crimson Reaper’s rotation. Vladimir’s swings are much more dramatic - larger health costs yield greater damage and healing, but also greater risk. Timing’s more important for Vlad as well: Crimson Rush’s cadence means Transfusion’s persistent threat goes down, while Tides of Blood’s new positional requirement can make or break a close-quarters encounter. We’re all for enabling Vlad’s indulgent, drain-tanking fantasy - provided he can survive long enough for his second wind to start the sustain train all over again.

									Malzahar
								
									
									
								
									Malzahar faces a constant dilemma: never use his abilities in lane or push constantly. This playstyle causes Malzahar to be very binary and non interactive; either he has enough AP to drop his spells on a wave and leave lane or he slowly pushes out, leaving him exposed to constant ganks. As well, the nature of his ultimate - cancelable by any CC - makes Malzahar’s power curve binary by necessity: you either stop his channel or somebody dies.
									In both cases, what Malzahar needs is leeway; a brief window of protection. Adding that window allows us to dial back on Malzahar’s burst and wave clear while giving him more sustained threat in a larger fight. Malz’s actions shouldn’t feel inevitable, but at least he’ll feel less bad about trying to make plays.
									He’ll still be the consistently damaging voidling master, but he should feel better about brawling near the frontlines when he brings more sustained cooldowns and a little bit of protection.

									Cassiopeia
								
									
									
								
									True to her half-snake nature, Cassiopeia bears twin identities of “poison mage” and “lightning-fast viper strikes.” However, the high-input gameplay of Twin Fang has left Cassiopeia wanting for greater impact in her poisons, instead viewing them as a gating condition for her combo damage.
									Rather than giving her more damaging poisons (Singed has that market cornered), we’ve sharpened Cassiopeia’s poison fantasy by linking Miasma to another snake fantasy: immobilization. The new Miasma lets Cassiopeia weaponize her own immobility by bringing opponents to her level. By limiting the ability of champions to leave her kill zone, Cassiopeia dictates the ranges of an engagement, keeping foes at a distance where she can wail on them safely. Should her opponents play around Miasma, however, Cassiopeia loses that control and faces swift punishment from the champions she sought to keep at bay.

									Zyra
								
									
									
								
									Zyra’s function as a zone-controlling plant mage has always been clear, but Midseason presented an opportunity to really let her playstyle bloom. Zyra’s plants are key to this zone-controlling strategy, but Rampant Growth’s seed-dispensing limitations have always left her wanting more. Zyra’s fantasy promises a sprawling landscape of minions to grow and do her bidding, but ends up as ‘grow two plants on a moderate cooldown that die pretty easily’.
									Now, Zyra doesn’t just plant a garden - she is the garden. Cultivating the ‘Rise of the Thorns’ into more than just a title, Zyra’s becoming a walking zone of threat, deploying seeds that grow into explosive teamfight potential the longer she’s in an area. Combining Stranglethorns’ plant-enhancing frenzy with more plants than ever before, Zyra’s reclaiming her strategic identity as the disengage pick, making would-be divers heed the warning to keep off the grass.

									Seeds spawn around Zyra periodically, becoming faster with level. If an enemy champion steps on a seed, it dies. If Zyra is hiding in brush, seeds will not spawn until she reveals herself. Casting Deadly Spines or Grasping Roots near seeds causes them to grow into Plants. Plants of the same type deal 50% less damage against the same target.

									Brand
								
									
									
								
									Brand's always been the guy who sets the world on fire with area damage and percent-health burns. Unfortunately for him, the proliferation of the percent-health mechanic in other spaces has robbed him of half of that identity. Even among mages, the Rylai's/Liandry's combo allows other champions to fill the same niche. This leaves Brand as a pretty generic source of damage, meaning he’s only picked when overtuned, rather than for any strategic purpose.
									We're updating Blaze to cement Brand's status as the go-to battle mage for AoE damage. No one punishes a team for clumping together like Brand: the new Blaze creates a volatile chain reaction as detonations stack Blaze onto all enemies caught in the blast, hastening their own detonations for even more explosive damage. Toss in a markedly more sadistic targeting system for Pyroclasm, and Brand becomes a true living inferno.

									Vel'Koz
								
									
									
								
									Vel'Koz has some cool things going for him - his research-and-destroy thematic, the combo playstyle of his passive, and his giant face laser to name a few. Problem is, there's no direction to these aspects. It makes little difference how or in what order Vel'Koz uses his abilities, so long as he hits them all to maximize his passive procs. Repeated bursts of true damage are good in any situation, so where does Vel’Koz shine?
									While some of our other mage updates overhaul the tools that define them, we're surgically adjusting Vel’Koz’s existing kit to accentuate his identity. Namely, Life Form Disintegration Ray's interaction with Organic Deconstruction has changed. Instead of quickly stacking his passive against anything in its path, Vel'Koz's laser now requires him to do his research first, paying off the investment with massive amounts of true damage. Where Organic Deconstruction stings, Disintegration Ray burns, making Vel'Koz is the artillery mage to pick when you need to melt through beefy tanks and fighters.

									Anivia
								
								
									One of our oldest champions, Anivia’s always been a power-pick for those willing to weather the storm of her steep mastery curve. While her strategic identity as a counter to heavy sieging is already strong, we saw an opportunity with Midseason to sharpen her traits as a disruptor even further. By focusing power into her already-potent CC, Anivia cements herself as a centerpiece for teams looking to seize control of the battlefield’s neutral ground.

									Annie
								
								
									Bears.
								
								
									Annie's simplicity as one of League’s original 40 belies a surprising amount of depth, but there are a few areas where her gameplay simply needs to be brought up to modern standards. The first is the lack of clarity around her stun. A skilled Annie learns to bypass Pyromania's indicator by sitting on three stacks, then burning Molten Shield to proc Pyromania as she throws out a near-instant stun. While this lends some degree of mastery to Annie's kit, it means a significant chunk of her power has been tied to outplaying the UI. Pyromania is now tracked on a resource bar and we’re moving that power elsewhere -- more on that later.
									The other half of Pyromania’s problem is actually Molten Shield, whose outdated design doesn’t offer enough for Annie to value it as anything other than a cheap Pyromania stack. Molten Shield is being modernized to a shorter, situationally powerful tool with clearer anti-burst uses against the likes of Zed ult, giving Annie a reason to feel good about it.
									Returning to the question of how we’re compensating Annie for losing her invisible stun, that power is being reallocated to Tibbers, the most unrealized aspect of Annie's fantasy as pyro girl with giant bear guardian. For being such an integral part of Annie’s character, Tibbers serves little purpose outside of a safer AoE spell than Incinerate for a flash-stun combo. We're putting some fury into Tibbers’ bear swipes and smartening up his AI to make him a persistent threat until killed, befitting his status as the infernal familiar Annie's always deserved.

									BEAR VENGEANCE If Annie dies while Tibbers is summoned, Tibbers instantly regenerates 50% of his missing health, enrages, and targets Annie’s killer. If Annie’s killer is too far away, Tibbers will focus the lowest health champion instead.
								
							
						
					
		        
		        
		        	
						
							
								
								
									Fiddlesticks
								
								
									Fiddlesticks is a special type of immobile: he actually has to stand still to use some of his abilities, leaving him slow to respond when team fights move away from him. By giving him the tools to go with the flow as the fight moves around, we’re sharpening his role as an explosive fight-starter, surprise party enthusiast, and spooky scary... scarecrow. This also gives us room to dial back on some of the more binary parts of Fiddle’s kit, like his long-ranged fear or his permadrain. The result is a more interactive Fiddlesticks who’s better able to position himself to make plays.

									Kennen
								
								
									Kennen's niche of \"dive the enemy team and stun kids\" is well-defined, but the randomness of who his ult zaps means his teamfighting impact is often left up to chance. Sometimes Slicing Maelstrom focus-fires a priority target on the far edge of its range, other times it ignores the squishy that Kennen’s right beside as they saunter off to safety. This can be just as frustrating for Kennen’s opponents; it all depends on who draws the short straw. We’re removing Slicing Maelstrom’s randomness to make it more consistent for both sides: Kennen will always stun enemies he’s allowed to stay close to, so it’s never a waste of resources to peel him off your backline.
									On a separate note, we cleaned up a few weird numbers in Kennen’s other abilities. Notably, Electrical Surge’s range was overly generous, so we’re trimming it to keep Kennen in harm’s way if he wants to jolt his enemies.

									Swain
								
								
									Despite his title, Swain’s largely failed to live up to his promise of a master tactician. Instead, Swain mains have come to embrace him as an unkillable teamfight-tanking monstrosity. Sometimes a champion having split identities can lead to balancing awkwardness (like Kalista, the solo outplay carry with insane teammate synergies), but Swain is more odd than problematic. Sure, ‘Commander Bird Monster’ is weird, but so is Shen being a tanky ninja. We’re not here to judge.
									Rather than force one identity over the other, we’re looking at ways to enhance Swain overall. Regardless of why you play the Master Tactician, he’s a tanky mage with DoT’s and that’s not changing. Instead, Swain’s updates are about using his abilities in the right situations to overcome the odds. Careful optimization and placement of his bread-and-butter spells gives Swain the room to tactically outpace the opposition before morphing into an even-more-Ravenous-Flock for the teamfight checkmate.

By giving Syndra more influence through Spheres, we can reward her mastery of manipulation with masterful mid-fight CC combos.

									Veigar
								
								
									Veigar's potential to go infinite with Baleful Strike’s AP gain on kill is a good fit for his theme of “little ball of evil with an overcompensation problem,” but means Veigar should care more about farming pitiful minions than blasting down enemy champions. We're retooling the mechanic as Veigar's new passive and opening it up to reward the Tiny Master of Evil for constantly asserting dominance over his opponents. While examining how Veigar antagonizes his enemies, we also changed Primordial Burst to give him the pick of the litter when obliterating low health enemies. He’ll have to press more than one button to erase an enemy mage, but even the most durable tank should carefully consider their health bar before re-engaging.

									Viktor
								
								
									Despite sporting a kit full of unique teamfighting tools, most of Viktor’s gadgets have been historically kept on a tight leash due to the efficiency of Death Ray’s infamous Augment: Shockwave. Viktor should feel rewarded for setting his schemes into motion (like trapping multiple enemies in a Gravity Field), but the ability to follow up with instant target deletion puts the ball too far in his court. By shifting Viktor’s damage to be higher over-time, we can hit two birds with one stone. Opponents aren’t evaporated for making a single mistake, and Viktor gets to carry a fight through intelligent play like the diabolical mastermind he is.

									Xerath
								
								
									Rite of the Arcane sets up Xerath’s unique high point: a long-ranged barrage that forces opponents to dance. However, it was often Arcanopulse with its consistent poke that gave him his siege monster reputation. While Xerath should be able to effectively siege with his basic abilities, we also want his signature ability to be more impactful, giving players a reason to access its power more often and for longer. By dialing back a little on the inevitability of Arcanopulse and upping the impact of Rite of the Arcane, we’re giving Xerath more chances to succeed with his ultimate, ensuring higher highs for experienced ascendants.

									Ziggs
								
								
									What would Ziggs do? The answer should almost always be “blow everything up,” but for an impulsive demolitionist, Ziggs spends a lot of time protecting turrets with his waveclear rather than knocking them down. Dialing back on his multi-lane wave clear lessens his ability to stall out games and drives more interactive gameplay with his opponents. In exchange, we’re giving the Hexplosives Expert the power to bring the boom to his enemies’ turrets, chunking them down with Short Fuse procs before hexploding them with Satchel Charge when they’re vulnerable. Let no turret be left standing!

				Mage Itemization
			
		
			
				
					
						League’s current mana and mana regen itemization is largely focused around stat efficiency: which item gives me the best ability to ignore my mana costs? This doesn’t lead to much in the way of playstyle differentiation, meaning mages have little flexibility to buy into different team strategies or respond to the conditions of a match as it progresses. We’re strengthening the identities of the mana items to give mages better tools to alter the way they play.
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Tear of the Goddess
					
					
						Refunds a portion of mana spent.
					
					
						Tear of the Goddess creates an odd conflict: it’s the mage item which gives the most raw mana (attractive to champions with high mana costs), but it has to be stacked up by constantly casting spells (something champions with high mana costs can’t afford to do). As such, it tends to be picked up by champions who can spam spells, making them effectively manaless as it stacks.We’re changing Tear’s pure regen to a mana refund, opening it up to high-mana cost champions, not just a select few spammers.

						newAWE UNIQUE Passive - Refunds 15% of mana spent
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Catalyst of Aeons
					
					
						Damage taken is converted to mana. Mana spent is converted to health.
					
					
						For some mages, the world is their 1v1. The current mana items don’t feel great for them, given how many options are aimed at passively surviving the laning phase. We’re making Catalyst the item for constant mage brawlers who want to shoot first, shoot later, and then shoot some more, allowing them to make full use of their skirmishing tendencies.

						Chalice of Harmony
					
					
						Restores health or mana, whichever is at a lower percent.
					
					
						Chalice is the go-to pick for champions who can easily clear waves, leading to a non-interactive lane phase as they spam their skills to keep the minions fighting at a safe distance. The new Chalice is still oriented at lane sustain, but in a way that encourages taking the occasional risk. If your health dips, Chalice will switch to healing you back up, ensuring you’ve got access to whichever regen effect you need most to dig your heels in for the long haul.
						As a quick point of differentiation: while the new Catalyst rewards champions while they fight, Chalice lets them stay in lane after trades, making it ideal for champions who fall on the more ‘opportunistic’ side of the spectrum.

						With Morellonomicon emerging as the go-to kill pressure item (spoilers!), Forbidden Idol’s safe regen no longer belongs its build path. We’re pulling Lost Chapter out of the Black Market as a component item for champions like LeBlanc who are in lane to net early kills, offering timed bursts of massive sustain to set up a full spell rotation or two.

						Rod of Ages
					
					
						Less expensive. Ability power and mana reduced.
					
					
						Rod of Ages has always offered the promise of a delayed but significant stat payout. These days, however, the identity of ‘big stat stick’ has lost meaning as items have evolved to serve more unique strategic purposes. The new Rod of Ages takes cues from Catalyst of Aeons: ride the efficiency of an early stat payoff (and a head start on your second item) to secure dominance over your enemies before they’ve built into more specialized item choices.

						Morellonomicon
					
					
						Gives mana instead of mana regeneration. Now restores mana on kill or assist.
					
					
						For the duration of their existences, Morellonomicon and Athene’s Unholy Grail have had significant overlap, sharing three stats, two component items, and the same distinction of offensive mage items with best-in-slot mana regen. While they go about defining ‘offense’ in different ways - Morellonomicon makes it easier to secure kills while Athene’s gives you the mana to go for more kills - these two items just aren’t meaningfully different from one another.
						Since we’re creating a split between mana and mana regen items, we’re taking the opportunity to split Morellonomicon and Athene’s as well. Morellonomicon is fully embracing its identity as an aggressive mage item, going so far as to absorb the old ‘mana resets’ passive of its former sibling Athene’s on top of its hallmark Grievous Wounds.

						Athene’s Unholy Grail has taken on a new role as a team sustain item for aggressive supports (and off-supports) like Lulu, Morgana, and Karma. These enchantresses naturally alternate between directly engaging in combat and protecting their team; Athene’s rewards them for striking an optimal balance by granting them a bit of persistent sustain that most lack.

						Abyssal Scepter
					
					
						Aura now scales with level and no longer affects minions. Now grants cooldown reduction.
					
					
						In a mage-vs-mage matchup, the winner often comes down to who finishes Abyssal Scepter first. Its 30 ability power bump on completion synergizes with its magic resist reduction aura to create a huge combat advantage upon completion. If that weren’t enough, the aura also makes it much easier to push minion waves into the enemy turret, denying opponents the gold necessary to finish their own Scepter. We’re repositioning Abyssal Scepter to play up its defensive aspects, while tuning its aura to be less oppressive in lane but more relevant in the late game.

						Zhonya’s Hourglass struggles to maintain two very expensive characteristics: it’s a top-tier ability power item that also boasts one of the strongest actives in the game. Historically, this duality has forced us to lock Zhonya’s behind a steep price tag or awkward build path - usually both. There are other items which offer tons of ability power, but no other item shares Zhonya’s’ active, so we’re going all-in on its identity as a defensive utility item. That decision has allowed us to drop the price of Zhonya’s to the lowest it’s ever been in League history, making it more readily available in times its stasis effect is truly needed.

				Hextech Items
			
		
			
				
					
					
						Hextech Revolver
					
					
						No longer gives spell vamp. Now adds bonus damage to basic attacks.
					
					
						Heading into our upgraded Hextech weaponry prompts an important question: why is all the spell vamp gone?
						Let’s start by comparing it to lifesteal. Thematically, lifesteal gives the feeling that you’re fighting back against death, creating tense 1 on 1 duels with uncertain outcomes. Mechanically, lifesteal says ‘I may have a small health bar but you’ve got to focus me down or I’ll regenerate to full.’ Spell vamp, while sounding similar, doesn’t quite hit the same bar. Unlike basic attacks, no two abilities are the same, which makes the stat wildly variable in value.
						This means that it’s functionally impossible to make spell vamp work the way you’d expect, and it instead operates on myriad edge-cases to avoid feeling abusive and unintuitive. Cut to today’s world where it’s only used on Vladimir (whose balance is kept lock-step with the stat), it’s easy to see why it had to go.
						So why buy into Hextech? Revolver (and its upgrades) are all about benefitting the mid-range mages that have to scrap to survive. Like Catalyst for sustain or Tear for becoming a late-game monster, Revolver represents a commitment to securing advantages through combat. While everyone’s waiting to power-up, Hextech provides the power spike you need to get the snowball rolling.

					new
					
						Hextech GLP-800
					
					
						Activate to spray enemies with icy bolts and slow them.
					
					
						While back-line artillery or shield-heavy utility mages can load up on ability power in whatever combination to get by (thanks to range or mitigation), mages that get up close and personal are forced to buy whatever will give them the stats to survive combat. Following in Revolver’s footsteps, Hextech remedies this situation by saying ‘If you have to be in the middle of a fight, you should have the extra firepower to customize how your encounters play out’.
						Enter the GLP-800. Targeted at CC-heavy mages that like to skirmish, GLP provides an extra spell cooldown and source of damage that allows you more in-fight flexibility. Need to peel an ally from a pesky diver? GLP’s got that. Worried you can’t land your combo? GLP can let you hit-confirm your CC and lock opponents down for good. You can even waveclear with it in a pinch! Whatever your particular in-fight need is, the GLP-800’s got your back to enable the beefier mages out there with the tools to get the job done.

						Where the GLP-800 is all about controlling distance via CC, the Hextech Protobelt’s all about picking the right moment for a daring maneuver. Whether you’re extending the effective range of a Flash Tibbers stun or dodging a crucial skillshot, Protobelt improves playmaking potential for those quick-witted enough to use its active. It’s not all sunshine and dash-extensions however; Hextech’s actives all share a cooldown, and Protobelt’s the least efficient in a six-item build. This means you’ll need to make every Fire Bolt count, and hopefully close out the game before it becomes obsolete.

Instead of rocking the boat, we tied it to a lightning mechanic (and made the active match) so it plays nice with the other Hextech upgrades. If you’re looking for pure, hybrid offense - look no further.

						Elemental Dragons
					
					
						Dragon has now been replaced by four Elemental Drakes. Slaying each provides your team with a powerful permanent bonus that stacks on multiple kills of the same type.
					
					
						Ever since launch, Dragon’s been an iconic objective to control in League. Whether it gives buffs or gold (or that time it spawned before minions did), Dragon’s purpose is to give people something to take risks and make decisions around. Fast forward to today, and while Dragon’s certainly very cool, it has its share of problems.
						First, the static value of Dragon’s stacks allows you to answer the question of ‘Which stacks do I want and when?’ long before you ever have to make the decision to fight for them. This devalues individual Dragon spawns - why rush the 1st stack now when you can just get it later? Furthermore, denying at least one stack virtually removes the threat of Aspect of the Dragon's game-ending power, making it more of a pipe dream than a path to victory.
						Our goal is to raise the cap on strategic mastery when it comes to playing around Dragon. With the advent of the Elementals, your ability to adapt on the fly becomes much more important. Questions change from a pre-solved ‘How much do we care about 1st stack, 2nd stack, etc?' to a situational ‘How much do we care about each element right now?’ Trading and denying become much more important (and realistic) possibilities as well - making sure the split-push team from hell doesn’t get access to the Mountain Drake’s turret-taking buff, while the Cloud Drake’s movement speed buff could be what you need to out-rotate them. Navigating these situations will take time to get used to, but pushes the dragon conversation to one of constantly shifting values instead of how much a certain stack is worth.

						Elder Dragon
					
					
						Grants a powerful burn-over-time on spells and attacks. Increases the strength of your Elemental Drake buffs.
					
					
						Previously, Aspect of the Dragon was a powerful closing tool - assuming the game ever hit a point where you could get it. Part of the promise of Elemental Dragons is that no matter which spawn in what order, controlling them is always valuable for you in the long run. Elder Dragon lets us kill two birds with one buff - cashing in on your hard-earned stacks and ensuring that both teams can leverage its strength (or steal it) to close out a game in style.

						Rift Herald
					
					
						Now only spawns once. Rift Herald’s buff lasts an incredibly long time, persists through death, and provides amazing dueling power.
					
					
						Now that Rift Herald’s been out for nearly half a year, it’s time to reevaluate our goals. Originally added to introduce a new dynamic between both halves of the Rift, Herald hasn’t quite made the splash we hoped for. Instead of driving action to the top side of the map, the Doom's Eve buff comes with too many conditions to be universally appreciated. Do I take this before or after taking a turret? Do I take it instead of a turret? When you trade lane pressure to take something that gives lane pressure, things get pretty muddy.
						That brings us to today. When optimized, junglers solo Rift Herald with very little help or notice from their team and power farm camps until it’s time to group. This wouldn’t matter much, except that no one seems to care about taking it. ‘Are they bot? Eh, we’ll take a Herald I guess.’ Even after RH falls, there's no clear game impact - someone’s just ambiguously stronger for a short period of time. With Midseason incoming and an objective falling short of strategic significance, we went back to the drawing board.
						With 6.9, we’re eliminating the confusion and refocusing Rift Herald to be an objective you really don’t want to give away for free. Enabling snowballing and split-pushers alike, Herald is a one-time event that puts the team it falls to firmly in the driver’s seat for the early stages of the game.

						Camps with timers indicate to both teams when they're close to respawning, via timers and the minimap.
					
					
						We want to facilitate more engaging objective play. A big part of accomplishing that is making them more worth contesting, but we also want them to be more contestable, especially in games that are at a standstill. Clearly communicating respawn timers will facilitate more buff steal plays and objective fights, particularly in mid-late game.

				Turrets
			
		
			
				
					
						Turret Stats
					
					
						Turrets are more durable, outer & inner turrets are more threatening, mages and assassins are better able to damage turrets.
					
					
						As players have gotten better at diving turrets, the structures have ceased to be defensible locations where teams can make a stand. We want to tone back on the perception of turrets as eventual sources of gold and instead let players feel good about defending the outermost reaches of their base (especially early game). Aggressive dives to punish laner mistakes should still be a part of the game, but we're balancing out the risk/reward distribution.

						Turret Rewards
					
					
						Team gold rewards reduced.
					
					
						The previous section covered our general thoughts on turrets, so we'll keep this short. Team gold rewards for outer and inner turret kills are too high compared to the payoff for anything else teams can invest in during the early game. While we've got changes to make the \"anything else\" more attractive (see: everything in the Jungle Bosses category), we want to make it clear that turrets are just one piece of the overall objective puzzle.

						Jungle Experience
					
					
						Monsters grant more experience to junglers but less to non-junglers.
					
					
						The tactic of a solo player abandoning lane to farm monster camps with their jungler (we call it 'buddy jungling') evolved in response to the 2v1 lane swap. Rather than sit under tower, zoned out of experience, top laners ditch their lanes for safer prospects. Buddy jungling is enabled by the 'comeback' mechanic, which increases monster experience for lower-level champions. Though the jungler and top laner are both constantly underleveled due to splitting camps, comeback experience softens the punishment by adding net experience versus a solo clear.
						The casualty of this technique is the early game itself: buddy jungling puts eight of the ten players on the Rift into a pure PvE situation. That leads to an incredibly stale opening phase of the match and eliminates the lane dynamics many of League’s early-game champs (Renekton!) rely on to make their impact.
						We're putting a damper on buddy jungling by removing the experience efficiency granted to the buddy. That’s not to say it isn’t still situationally viable - having two people in the jungle can offer strategic value - we’re just ensuring it’s a careful decision rather than default behavior.
					
					
						ONLY FOR THE WORTHY Non-epic jungle monsters now only grant experience to their killers
					
					
						removedCATCH-UP Jungle monster experience rewards no longer increase when you’re lower level than the slain monster
					
					
						newFARM RAZORBEAKS All Jungle items now grant 30 bonus experience on monster kill for each level higher the monster is than you
					
					
						TIER 1 JUNGLE ITEMS Hunter’s Machete and Hunter’s Talisman grant 15 ⇒ 50 bonus experience on large monster kill
					
					
						TIER 2 JUNGLE ITEMS Stalker’s Blade, Skirmisher’s Sabre, and Tracker’s Knife grant 30 ⇒ 50 bonus experience on large monster kill
					
					
						HUNTING GROUND Based on the above changes, total jungle experience rewards have been adjusted. Overall, junglers now get slightly more experience per clear while non-junglers get slightly less.
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Death Timers
					
					
						Death timers reduced between 20-35 minutes.
					
					
						We last checked in on death timers back in 6.7, shortening them in the 30-55 minute time frame. Results look positive, so we’re making another small nudge.
					
					
						CAN I LIVE? Death timers slightly reduced around the 20-35 minute window
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Homeguard
					
					
						Homeguard duration and speed reduced, particularly early on.
					
					
						Back in preseason we baked Homeguard into the standard Summoner’s Rift experience for two purposes: to create better boot enchantment diversity and to counter-balance increases to death timers. More on boot enchantments later in these patch notes, but let’s talk about Homeguard’s coexistence with death timers.
						Time spent dead creates a window of safety for teams to act, knowing that dead enemies are gray-screened in the fountain. On revival, Homeguard catapults champions out of base and into position to counter enemy sieges or rotations. Aside from just getting somewhere faster, the haste adds flexibility: if the enemy team appears bot as you’re heading top, Homeguard allows you to adjust before too much damage is done.
						That flexibility creates a stalling effect as death timers tick down: “Can we take this turret before the enemy zooms in and dives our backline?” That unease shortens the window of safety to act, magnifying the effect of actual death timer reductions: 2 seconds off a 30 second death timer is actually 2 seconds off a ~25 second window. This is particularly true at earlier stages of the game, thanks to Homeguard’s static effects.
						So, after leaving things untouched back in 6.7, we’re now toning Homeguard’s haste down to account for both rounds of death timer reductions and scaling it with game time to ensure its impact doesn’t choke out early aggression.
					
					
						HASTE DURATION 8 seconds ⇒ 7 seconds
					
					
						HASTE AMOUNT 175% ⇒ 75% at 20 minutes, scaling up to 150% at 40 minutes

						R no longer pins targets to walls
					
					
						The flashy playmaking nature of Azir's ult befits his status as ruler of an empire, but Emperor's Divide becomes oppressive when it pins enemies against terrain for 5+ seconds. We're removing the abuse case to keep Azir honest.

						Illaoi
					
					
						Vessel debuff greatly shortened, but spawns tentacles faster.
					
					
						Despite being Illaoi’s most interesting ability, Test of Spirit mostly ends up testing the patience of those involved. Being tested forces a tough choice onto Illaoi’s opponents, telling them fight or suffer the consequences. This choice is usually a trap - fighting Illaoi in close quarters is a death sentence given her massive area damage. Escaping the zone means slogging through waves of tentacles, which isn’t much better most of the time.
						On Illaoi’s side, turning someone into a vessel is really only a consideration for the laning phase. Once you’re testing spirits in teamfights, the minute-long debuff rarely matters. We want all participants of the Test to feel like they’re getting a fair shake, so we’re shifting around some mechanics to compress what it means to be a vessel. Illaoi gets to pressure opponents in a way that’s meaningful in teamfights (her forte), but her victims don’t have to deal with her lectures for an eternity.

						Let’s call a wolf a wolf - Kindred’s early game is out of line. We want Kindred to be able to pressure the map (especially through expert control of their Marks), but invading top-tier duelists with impunity is pushing it. We’re adjusting their clearing ability to stay roughly the same, but Kindred will need to pick their battles a little more carefully if they want to start scaling out of control.

						Rengar
					
					
						E no longer flies in random directions.
					
					
						These are mostly bugfixes, with the exception of Bola Strike. Previously, Bola Strike would always try to fire at the location Rengar targeted once its cast delay completed. When targeting distant points, Rengar's movement (ex. a jump strike out of ult) during Bola Strike's short cast time wouldn't change much. When targeting a nearby spot, however, Rengar could suddenly end up in front of the target location he had previously been behind. Bola Strike would then fire in the complete opposite direction it was cast. We're changing Bola Strike's targeting system to fix that unreliability.

						Soraka
					
					
						Q slow and movement speed down. No longer refreshes Windspeaker’s.
					
					
						Soraka’s changes are all about injecting more risk when she wades into the fray to provide assistance. For a champion that already pumps out amazing heals, the strength of Soraka’s kiting doubles up on denying any sort of aggression that comes her way. By cutting down on Starcall’s over-the-top protective tools, Soraka becomes less of a one-stop-shop for protection without losing the healing potential she’s picked for.
						Lastly, a quick note on Rejuvenation’s on interaction with Windspeaker’s Blessing. Windspeaker’s was made in a world without any healing over time effects - and as such, wasn’t really balanced around high uptimes. Enter Soraka’s Rejuvenation mechanic back in 6.5 and now she’s tossing around 6-8 second armor and magic resist buffs off of a single spellcast. It’s possible that we revisit this mechanic and work on clearly defined rules about how HoT’s (and other heals) should interact with Windspeakers, but for now we’re not comfortable with the amount of strength it’s adding to a single champion.

						Taric
					
					
						Base mana up, mana growth down. W range down. E is shorter and narrower.
					
					
						An old champion with a new coat of gems, Taric’s tearing up the battlefield while keeping his teammates spotless. A protector in the truest sense, the issue of Taric’s current power level isn’t how well he saves his allies - but rather the considerable range at which he’s able to influence the fight. This doesn’t come up much in lane (as Taric’s usually next to his bastion-buddy), but once ganks and teamfights start entering the picture things get messy. We’re trimming Taric’s excess power and focusing him around being the dependable shield you carry with you to a fight, committing him to stick close to his team if he wants to have the same impact.

						Teemo
					
					
						More traps.
					
					
						Alright. We know people are going to come into this section thinking ‘Why buff Teemo?’, but let’s be honest with ourselves. While Teemo’s always been a serviceable laner, the Swift Scout has been on the weaker side of the spectrum for a long while. The root causes are many, but we’re targeting two: Teemo’s awkward mana usage, and his inability to set up the mushroom fields he’s known for.
						Getting into specifics, Teemo players find themselves opting into sometimes ranking up W - Move Quick not because it’s particularly good, but so the costs of his other spells don’t go through the roof. Similarly, a Teemo that’s behind is pressured against laying traps due to their high cost and cooldown, making them lackluster when the enemy team’s already gaining control of the map. Releasing the mana pressures across Teemo’s kit allows him to spend more time thinking critically about when and where to use his abilities.

						Most tanks have been excited to jump into the fray in 2016, but Zac’s been unexpectedly absent. Zac’s already best-in-class when it comes to getting into sticky situations, but Cell Divison shifts dramatically from an early-game boon to a limp extended late-game death. Considering long-range initiation is kind of Zac’s thing, the fact that he tends to land in risky situations shouldn’t feel as punishing as it does later on. We’re tweaking the Secret Weapon’s specs to help him maneuver the backlines and to give him a fighting chance of bouncing back into action (should his team provide the necessary assistance).

						Boot Enchantments
					
					
						With Homeguard no longer being tied to the enchantment system, almost all of the remaining options are very broad bonuses to movement. As seen earlier this season, bonus movement speed is a dangerous thing to stack, with boot enchants being a major contributor. When considering how warping Alacrity’s been toward introducing movement speed into the item system (and how potentially warping Captain or Fervor can be), we’re pulling the system to put a tighter leash on the ways champions can gain extra speed.
						It’s possible that we’ll revisit the concept of boot enchants in the future, but only after we find ways for it help dodge mobility creep - not enforce it.

						Enchantment: Devourer
					
					
						Goodbye, Ghost Dog.
					
					
						For years we’ve tried to provide junglers an item that helps them burn through the jungle, but despite multiple seasons of iteration we’ve failed to find an incarnation of ‘stacking jungle rewards’ that wasn’t problematic. While Devourer is an incremental improvement over past incarnations (shout-outs to those who remember Feral Flare’s insane healing and vision control), the primary problem with ‘farming junglers’ is that you don’t see them for half the game. Junglers are an integral part of how teams in League operate, and incentivizing them to AFK for the 15 minutes is too high a cost to be healthy long-term. We still want to support junglers that like high attack speed and on-hit builds, but this isn’t the way to do it.

					new?
					
						Enchantment: Bloodrazor
					
					
						Everything old is new again.
					
					
						Bloodrazor’s back from its years of traveling the world to be the jungle item we deserve. Attack speed junglers break down into different audiences, and Bloodrazor caters to both. Tankier on-hit champions (like Shyvana and Warwick) will find it an appropriate centerpiece to their natural synergies, while Kindred and Master Yi can pair it with Blade of the Ruined King and armor penetration for scaling builds.
						The removal of Devourer and the inclusion of Bloodrazor means that junglers will feel better about jumping directly into battle after finishing their item rather than waiting for it to power up. There will always be junglers who prioritize farming, and there will always be junglers that will rarely gank your lane - the key is that these decisions will be up to the player and their champion’s kits, not forced by the items they buy into.

						Guinsoo's Rageblade
					
					
						Upgraded to an end-game item. Now has Sated Devourer’s Phantom Hit passive.

					
					
						We couldn’t have a section with Devourer without addressing Guinsoo’s Rageblade as well. Rageblade’s a controversial item on live, but we’re convinced it feels far more overbearing than it actually is. Its power blooms specifically in the hands of basic-attack focused champions looking to snowball a lead, versus being generically too powerful. Even when it’s played on other champions (shout-outs to Tristana), it’s to fill a specific early-game niche.
						That said, a large part of Guinsoo’s balance depends on it being kept behind a few really unsatisfying barriers. For instance, it has the worst build path in the game - creating a low point of power as you struggle to accumulate its exorbitant combine cost. On the flip side, finishing Rageblade spikes you far harder than most items at that price point, creating a race to keep Rageblade users down before they can become relevant. When the correct play against Rageblade is ‘snowball incredibly hard or lose,’ we can do better.
						Our solution is to upgrade Guinsoo’s into a top-tier endgame item for the champions who value hybrid stats and on-hit builds. This allows for a more steady progression of power, as well as allowing us to put the much-coveted ‘Phantom Hit’ passive within arm’s reach of non-junglers. We’ll let you think of some of the more powerful combos (Aatrox?), but rewarding champions with access to top-shelf on-hit insanity once they’ve committed to combat feels like an appropriate gate for skirmishers and divers alike.

						Cost reduced. -5 AD.
					
					
						For those keeping up with recent top lane trends, builds have skewed toward the tankier end for the majority of 2016. Black Cleaver is a natural ‘release valve’ to help counter these champions, providing necessary shred and sticking power to run down even the beefiest defenders. When we noticed that its primary users (Renekton, Gnar, Riven to name a few) weren’t in the best spot performance wise, it made sense to bring the item that binds them together down to the price-points of other important powerspikes.

						Spectre's Cowl
					
					
						Costs more. More health, less magic resist.
					
					
						After reshaping and reinforcing the equipment mages have at their disposal, it stands to reason that we’d bolster the options to defend against them as well. Maw and Abyssal Scepter are solid purchases for the damage-minded, but the marquee tank options of the magic resist family need some work.
						All of that begins with Spectre’s Cowl. Funnily enough, Cowl actually has the opposite problem of its upgrades - it’s too efficient for its cost, to the point that tanks are often happy leaving it un-upgraded far into the game. We want them to feel good about sitting on Cowl in lane, but tinkering with its efficiency should pressure tanks into spending more gold to get their desired magical defenses.

						Banshee's Veil
					
					
						Health and cost down. Recipe changed.
					
					
						Banshee’s Veil offers an entirely unique effect in the item lineup, but its similar  price-point and statline to Spirit Visage do more harm than good for BV’s chances of actually being purchased.  Normally too expensive compared to its cousin, we’re shrinking Veil to be the earlier buy that guards against a burst mage gone wild, with an accordingly slimmer stat line. This makes it less effective in a full item build if you’re aiming for pure defense, but more accessible for those in need of a spell shield on a budget.

						On the other side of the Spectre’s Cowl, Spirit Visage is a popular pick-up that’s purchased for its pure protective stats. To differentiate it from Veil’s more immediate benefits, we’re pushing Spirit Visage to more comfortably fit within final builds by emphasizing its synergies with other tank items (like Warmog’s).

						Quicksilver Sash & Mercurial Scimitar
					
					
						Active now only removes crowd control debuffs.
					
					
						The QSS and Mercurial Scimitar active has two uses: cleansing crowd control (Amumu ult) and purging combat debuffs (Zed ult). These cases differ in that crowd control is setup, while combat debuffs are the payoffs to such setup. When you cleanse CC, the enemy needs to lock you down again to aggress on you, but that tends to be a pretty reasonable ask. By contrast, cleansing a combat debuff wipes the applicator's primary means of fighting you. So, those champs are pressured to snowball before their effects become meaningless, while their opponents are forced into buying QSS even if it's incredibly inefficient to do so. This leads to destructive effects on game balance which we've left unanswered for too long. With the understanding that there may be outliers we need to address, we're unshackling combat debuff champs from their quicksilver collars.

						Hexdrinker, Maw of Malmortius & Sterak’s Gage
					
					
						Sterak’s Gage and Maw of Malmortius shields no longer stack. Sterak’s Fury and Lifegrip now both proc when Lifeline is triggered.
					
					
						Maw and Sterak’s have complementary defensive triggers: Maw cares about how low you are while Sterak’s cares about how fast you’re dropping. This presents an interesting choice in lane: which item is best for the situation you’re in? Unfortunately, that choice becomes meaningless as the game progresses and beefy champs stack both items to cover all their bases. We’re tying the shields of Maw and Sterak’s together to ensure that picking one is a choice, not just the earlier of two purchases.
					
					
						WELCOME TO THE FAMILY Sterak’s Gage’s shield is now classified as a Lifeline effect along with the shields from Hexdrinker and Maw of Malmortius
					
					
						ONE LIFE ONE LINE When a Lifeline effect triggers, all Lifeline items are put on the cooldown of the triggered item. Only the triggered effect’s shield is granted.
					
					
						DOUBLE DUTY Sterak’s Fury and Maw’s Lifegrip are now both granted on either Lifeline trigger
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Bami's Cinder
					
					
						Health down.
					
					
						Compared to Giant’s Belt, Bami’s Cinder provides everything you want and more out of a defensive component. Given that it’s already got the offensive edge, we’re pulling back on Cinder’s efficiency so it’s not always a no-brainer.
					
					
						HEALTH 300 ⇒ 280
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Sunfire Cape
					
					
						Cost up.
					
					
						Similar to Bami’s Cinder, Sunfire’s efficient stats and hybrid offense/defense means it’s just the best early buy in most cases. Nudging it back to the price point of the other big Health/Armor makes it easier to pick the one for the right situation, not just whichever’s the cheapest.
					
					
						TOTAL COST 2700 gold ⇒ 2900 gold
					
					
						COMBINE COST 800 gold ⇒ 1000 gold
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Enchantment: Cinderhulk
					
					
						Aura scales better with levels.
					
					
						For an item meant to help tanks scale into the lategame, Cinderhulk’s been all but forgotten next to the shiny base damage of Runic Echoes. With Cinderhulk’s intended role as an investment toward a tank’s endgame statline, it didn’t make much sense for it to end up weaker than Sunfire Cape’s aura (considering they don’t stack). We’re fixing things to break even with old Cinderhulk at level 6, around when most junglers are completing it anyways.
					
					
						IMMOLATE DAMAGE 15 + 0.6 per level ⇒ 7 + 2 per level
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Vision Ward
					
					
						Less health, but regenerates health while out of combat.
					
					
						Yes, this is technically a Jhin buff.
						With their rise in popularity (ever since Stealth Wards sold out), the prevalence of Vision Wards has highlighted how cumbersome it is to clear them out. In keeping with the themes of Midseason, we’re easing the burden of cutting down successive pinks while making them more valuable to defend. Vision Wards have always been a mini-objective, so now we’re formalizing it.
					
					
						BASE HEALTH 5 ⇒ 4
					
					
						newREWARDING Now regenerates 1 health every 3 seconds after 5 seconds out of combat.
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Farsight Alteration
					
					
						Cooldown up.
					
					
						When it comes to diversity of Trinkets, Farsight’s been on top of the vision-throne for long while. Come mid-game, stacking Farsight trinkets changes the vision game drastically - rendering certain strategies revolving around making picks or ambushing virtually obsolete. We’re happy that Farsight’s more flexible in a wider number of vision-control strategies, we’re just adjusting so it’s not also crowding out the space entirely.
					
					
						COOLDOWN 90-60 seconds (at levels 9-18) ⇒ 148-99 seconds (at levels 9-18)
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Righteous Glory
					
					
						No longer speeds up allies. Active speed amount and duration increased. 
					
					
						In its current incarnation, Righteous Glory presents us with a few balancing troubles. When it’s too strong, it replaces traditional initiation and warps the environment to be ‘who are the best carriers of Righteous Glory and why aren’t you playing them?’ We’re removing that consideration altogether and really pushing its synergies with individual champions. It’ll be easier than ever for Righteous Glory users to run down fleeing targets, but they'll need more clever coordination than just ‘run as 5 in a straight line’ to start off a chaotic brawl.
					
					
						COST 2600 gold ⇒ 2500 gold
					
					
						newETERNITY UNIQUE Passive - 15% of damage taken from champions is gained as Mana. Spending mana restores 25% of mana spent as Health, up to 25 health per cast (Toggle spells heal for up to 25 per second).
					
					
						removedASSEMBLE Active no longer speeds up allies
					
					
						ACTIVE MOVEMENT SPEED 60% ⇒ 75%
					
					
						ACTIVE HASTE DURATION 3 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
					
					
						ACTIVE SLOW 80% ⇒ 75%
					
					
						ACTIVE SLOW DURATION 1 second ⇒ 2 seconds
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Warmog's Armor
					
					
						Health slightly reduced, now grants cooldown reduction.
					
					
						Despite its game-changing out-of-combat regeneration, Warmog’s Armor struggles to find a spot in builds for tanks and juggernauts alike. It’s not that the item’s subpar, but it simply doesn’t fit what most champions in these classes really need out of a gold investment. Tossing in a Kindlegem should help Warmog’s feel comparable to say, Spirit Visage when planning out your needs in a 6-item build.
					
					
						TOTAL COST 2850 gold (unchanged)
					
					
						BUILD PATH Giant's Belt + Kindlegem + Crystalline Bracer + 400 gold
					
					
						HEALTH 850 ⇒ 800
					
					
						newCOOLDOWN REDUCTION +10%
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Relic Shield Line
					
					
						Less healing.
					
					
						While not specifically tied to any of our other systems changes, botlane’s feeling a little high on resources these days. The botlane meta’s always lived between the extremes of being an all-in lane with low tolerance for mistakes and a sustaining paradise where poke and attrition mean very little. The pendulum’s a little too far on the ‘poke matters less’ part of that spectrum, so we’re toning back sustain from some of the more common purchases.
					
					
						Relic Shield
					
					
						CHARGE COOLDOWN 60 seconds ⇒ 40 seconds
					
					
						HEALING PER CHARGE 40 health ⇒ 20 health
					
					
						Targon's Brace
					
					
						HEALING PER CHARGE 50 health ⇒ 40 health
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Spellthief's Edge Line
					
					
						Less mana regeneration.
					
					
						Regeneration overall is a bit too free, so we’re taking some of botlane’s mana as well.
					
					
						Frostfang
					
					
						MANA REGENERATION 100% ⇒ 75%
					
					
						Frost Queen's Claim
					
					
						MANA REGENERATION 100% ⇒ 75%
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
					
						Arcane Sweeper
					
					
						It’s a creepy eyeball. Was this ever really hextech to begin with?
					
					
						NAME Hextech Sweeper ⇒ Arcane Sweeper
					
				
			
		
		
			Back to top
		
		
				Grievous Wounds
			
		
			
				
					
						Reverted to affect all healing, not just self-healing.
					
					
						Sometimes, changes don’t really work out. This is one of those times. Grievous wounds working off of self-healing created a sense of hopelessness when facing stronger healers and general confusion about what applying it would functionally do. We’re reverting it to make sense with the expectation of what a healing debuff should do.
					
					
						GENERALLY GRIEVOUS Reduces self healing by 40% ⇒ all healing received by 40%

				Skin Clarity Updates
			
		
			
				
					
						Like our recent work on Underworld Twisted Fate, we're revisiting eight skins whose VFX were pretty far below clarity standards. (Fun fact: all eight skins were disabled in competitive play.) Skins should be fun, alternative fantasies, not competitive advantages, so we're bringing their visual effects up to par.
					
					Ravenborn LeBlanc’s launch pads for W - Distortion are brighter and slightly larger
						Cosmic Reaver Kassadin’s Q - Null Sphere projectile is larger. Added a ring element for E- Force Pulse’s ready state.
						
						Headhunter Caitlyn’s Passive - Headshot now has glow particles on her hands when ready (in addition to the ones on her gun)
						
						Lunar Revel Caitlyn’s basic attack is now less noisy and aligns more with her base
						
						Blood Moon Elise’s E - Cocoon looks more like a cocoon, as opposed to Ahri's Charm. W - Skittering Frenzy has been cleaned up and now leaves the screen faster and is less noisy.
						
						Firecracker Jinx’s Q- Fishbones explosions have been cleaned up and have less smoke effects
						
						Forecast Janna’s Q - Howling Gale has been lightened for better visibility
						
						Dark Valkyrie Diana’s Q - Crescent Strike particle has been modified to make the brights brighter and darks darker

				Bugfixes
			
		
			
				
					Fixed a bug where Karthus's abilities sometimes failed to apply the slow from Rylai's Crystal Scepter during Passive - Death Defied. (We jumped the gun on listing this last patch - sorry!)
						While in Passive - Death Defied, Karthus no longer creates extraneous visual effects when casting Q - Lay Waste out of range 
						
						Quinn no longer fails to proc Passive - Harrier when attacking a marked target immediately after canceling an attack
						
						Oracle Alteration now indicates its sweep range when hovered
						
						Fixed a bug that prevented players from joining premade lobbies while waiting out queue dodge penalties
						
						Fixed a Clubs tag display issue with tags that started with a \"-\"
						
						Fixed a bug where some players couldn't see their own Clubs tag in New Champ Select lobbies
						
						Ward placement VO lines no longer play globally for allies on some champions and skins
						
						Snow Day Singed's recall audio is no longer global
						
						Battlecast Alpha Skarner no longer occasionally plays base Skarner's VO
						
						Gravelord Azir no longer sometimes plays base Azir's VO on top of his own lines
						
						Blackfrost Anivia's Passive - Rebirth channeling audio has been restored

		Greetings, summoners.
		Welcome to patch 6.8, the one before mid-season (pre-mid-season?!). We’ll have more than enough time to talk about the specifics of that spicy update, but for the moment let’s ask this question - how do we balance in the face of an impending major update?
		As you’d expect, the answer is ‘carefully.’ Knowing that all sorts of changes are coming for mages and their items limits what we can do in the short-term. Why buff a mage item or champion when we’ll be making sweeping changes to the entire class? Alternatively (I’m talking to you, Riven mains), buffing a champion that’s underperforming due to the current landscape is equally difficult, knowing that everything is about to change. Who gets stronger when the update hits? Who’s weaker? Does Zed still kill everyone (probably)? So, instead of talking about what we’re not changing in 6.8, let’s talk about what we are.
		If our goal is to be careful, then that means focusing on outliers - either too dominant or too weak - that we don’t think mid-season will impact significantly. We’re toning down some early-game sustain, as well as the main offenders in the ‘Everyone Gets To Be A Tank’ party (Ekko, Iceborn Gauntlet). We’re also showing love to some fan favorites (MF, Rumble) that play particularly well with and against the wizardly warriors to be spruced up next patch.
		Mix it all together with a fabulous new Taric and you’ve got yourself a medium-sized patch with just enough excitement to hold you over until a cadre of updated mages waltz up and optic blast you into the next dimension (look out for Malzahar). That’s all for us this patch - we’ll see you around the Rift, playing some new champion named ‘Galio’.
		Good luck, have fun.

					Ekko
				
				
					W and E base damage down, but AP scaling increased.
				
				
					Ekko’s rampage through toplane may be a problem of the present, but this isn’t the first time this has happened. To recap our feelings about Tank Ekko (from way back in 5.15) - it’s about tradeoffs. AP Ekko earns his game-ending skirmish potential by putting himself at constant risk: Chronobreak and Parallel Convergence are unwieldy when Ekko’s fragile enough to die before he can use them optimally. Tank Ekko’s survivability makes these tools much more reliable, but due to a combination of low cooldowns and high base damage, he still brings the beatdown as well. We’re fine with Tank Ekko shining in specific situations, but significantly lowering the build’s damage output (relative to AP-focused builds) ensures Ekko’s risk-reward paradigm is kept in check.
				
				
					W - Parallel Convergence
				
				
					PASSIVE ON-HIT DAMAGE 5% of the target’s missing health ⇒ 3% of the target’s missing health
				
				
					PASSIVE ON-HIT RATIO 1% per 50 ability power ⇒ 1% per 33 ability power
				
				
					newI LIKE HITTING YOU Now deals a minimum of 15 damage to minions and monsters
				
				
					E - Phase Dive
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 50/80/110/140/170 ⇒ 40/65/90/115/140
				
				
					RATIO 0.2 ability power ⇒ 0.4 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Galio
				
				
					E costs less and gives more movement speed.
				
				
					Galio presents a powerful option for those who like to make a big impact in close quarters, but often runs out of steam before teams start grouping up. We’re tossing him a stone to help smooth his laning interactions (especially when pushed into his tower), as well as enable sweet roaming plays if the situation arises.
				
				
					E - Righteous Gust
				
				
					COST 70/75/80/85/90 mana ⇒ 60/65/70/75/80 mana
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 20/28/36/44/52% ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Graves
				
				
					Basic attacks deal less damage, but crits are more valuable.
				
				
					Graves doesn’t know the first thing about time-travel, but he and Ekko share a lot of similarities this patch - they deal tons of damage, and they’re practically unkillable. While Graves isn’t building pure defense, his unique interactions with lifesteal and basic-attack scaling let him get away with prioritizing efficient hybrid defensive items (Death’s Dance, Maw, Sterak’s) to wreck early and wreck late. We’re retuning New Destiny’s specs so Graves has to make a choice between being critting people’s heads off or being the gritty, sustained cleanup crew.
				
				
					Passive - New Destiny
				
				
					RATIO ON FIRST HIT 0.75 - 1.1 total attack damage (from levels 1-18) ⇒ 0.7 - 1.0 total attack damage (from levels 1-18)
				
				
					BULLETS ON CRIT 8 ⇒ 6
				
				
					newCRITICAL THINKING Each crit bullet deals 140% damage (Infinity Edge increases this to 160%)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kog'Maw
				
				
					Q shred up at early levels. W damage down.
				
				
					When last we joined Kog’Maw on his adventures through patch notes, we spoke a lot about giving hypercarries a more even power curve than just ‘great late, awful early.’ These changes are furthering that philosophy, letting Kog feel like he gets to have a Q and reining in his insane power spike.
				
				
					Q - Caustic Spittle
				
				
					ARMOR/MR SHRED 12/16/20/24/28% ⇒ 20/22/24/26/28%
				
				
					W - Bio-Arcane Barrage
				
				
					BASE ON-HIT DAMAGE 10/15/20/25/30 ⇒ 4/8/12/16/20
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Master Yi
				
				
					R cooldown up and duration down, but its reset duration increased.
				
				
					While much of Master Yi’s strength comes from his synergy with two powerful items (Guinsoo’s Rageblade + Sated Devourer), his lack of downtime has always been a frustration. We’re tuning Yeezy’s all-in window to reward using Highlander at the right time, rather than ‘whenever.’
				
				
					R - Highlander
				
				
					COOLDOWN 75 seconds ⇒ 85 seconds
				
				
					DURATION 10 seconds ⇒ 7 seconds
				
				
					EXTENSION ON KILL OR ASSIST 4 seconds ⇒ 7 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Miss Fortune
				
				
					W duration and cooldown up. Love Tap no longer extends W’s duration, but now reduces its cooldown.
				
				
					Ever since Miss Fortune’s dominating preseason performance, the Bounty Hunter’s business seems to be anything but booming. Her contributions to clustered fights are still worth a pretty silver serpent, but MF’s ability to compete alongside her marksman siblings outside of that best-case scenario is lacking. Retuning Strut for higher potential uptime should bring Miss Fortune’s baseline a little closer to the expectations of her class, without hindering the unique bullet-hell style of teamfighting she’s known for.
				
				
					W - Strut
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED DURATION 3 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
				
				
					COOLDOWN 8 seconds ⇒ 12 seconds
				
				
					removedTAP DANCING Applying Love Tap no longer extends the duration
				
				
					newSTRUT YOUR STUFF Cooldown now begins on-cast instead of when the buff expires
				
				
					newGUNS BLAZING While Strut is on cooldown, applying Love Tap reduces its remaining cooldown by 2 seconds (scales down with cooldown reduction)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Olaf
				
				
					W lifesteal and R’s armor and magic resist increased.
				
				
					Olaf’s a champion that has all the tools necessary to stick to targets and wreck faces in a big brawl, but there’s one problem: he’s dying too fast. Berserkers thrive in bloody combat, so we’re amping Olaf’s durability to tip the scales in his favor when he picks the right moment to go all-out (instead of falling flat).
				
				
					W - Vicious Strikes
				
				
					LIFESTEAL 9/12/15/18/21% ⇒ 14/16/18/20/22%
				
				
					R - Ragnarok
				
				
					PASSIVE ARMOR/MR 10/20/30 ⇒ 20/30/40
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Rumble
				
				
					Q deals full damage to minions. R’s cooldown lowered.
				
				
					Once a professional staple, Rumble’s struggled to succeed in 2016. This scrappy yordle’s game is one of attrition; nickel-and-diming opponents with persistent damage and forcing them out of lane (or Equalizing them for overstaying their welcome). This season’s premium sustain options - Corrupting Potion and Grasp of the Undying - has left Rumble lacking the ability to get damage to stick. Rather than commit ourselves to an arms-race of upping his damage to compete with early game sustain (which we’re taking a swing at further below), we’re opting to instead give Rumble greater flexibility in lane control.
				
				
					General
				
				
					RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE Now has a recommended item page for Jungle
				
				
					Q - Flamespitter
				
				
					DAMAGE TO MINIONS 50% ⇒ 100%
				
				
					R - The Equalizer
				
				
					COOLDOWN 120/110/100 seconds ⇒ 110/100/90 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Splash Updates
				
				
					11 completely new splashes that’ll be around for a long time.
				
				
					As mentioned last patch, the Global Splash Unification work is a short-term solution. So, what’s the long-term solution? Comprehensive updates like the eleven splashes here. Splash updates are now baked into our Champion Update process (see: Poppy, Shen, and of course Taric), and we’ll opportunistically release small batches like this one when we can.

			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Iceborn Gauntlet
				
				
					Proc damage decreased.
				
				
					Sheen’s always offered champions with low cooldowns and high base damage a cost-efficient damage option (without having to go too far into full-damage builds). From there, the branching paths tell the story of what you want your Sheen to do. Do I want an extra AP Ratio? Lichbane. Do I want to deal tons of damage? Trinity Force. In-fight utility? Iceborn Gauntlet. The latter has done a fantastic job of holding up its utility promise - but the extra damage it provides is allowing beefier builds to squeeze too much effectiveness out of their kits. Given how much cheaper it is to build than the other Sheen upgrades, we’re taking a stab at sharpening those identities and making Iceborn markedly weaker than its alternatives at winning duels.
				
				
					SPELLBLADE 125% base attack damage ⇒ 100% base attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Mercurial Scimitar
				
				
					Cost and attack damage lowered.
				
				
					Mercurial Scimitar is really gold efficient. Reaaaaally gold efficient. That’s not a problem by itself, but when tied to an incredibly powerful active in the form of Quicksilver Sash’s omni-cleanse, over-efficiency pushes Scimitar over the edge. Mercurial’s often purchased for its amazing statline alone, and its active is conveniently countering a lot of champions in the process. Scimitar’s still a great choice for a carry under pressure, but shrinking its efficiency means it makes less sense without a clear use for the active.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 3700 gold ⇒ 3600 gold
				
				
					COMBINE COST 625 gold ⇒ 525 gold
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 75 ⇒ 65
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Corrupting Potion
				
				
					Gives less health but more mana.
				
				
					Corrupting Potion was our attempt at allowing champions to declare their intent to fight via its burn effect: compared to the Doran’s items, Corrupting Potion only gets its full value if you take advantage of its burn by trading aggressively with other champions.
					Unfortunately, the high sustain on Corrupting Potion also makes it the go-to item for champions who want to passively sit in lane. While the mana enables champions to trade more often, the health is just delaying recalls to base. We’re sharpening the trading aspects of Corrupting Potion while dialing back on the sustain.
				
				
					HEALTH REGENERATION 150 health per charge ⇒ 125 health per charge
				
				
					MANA REGENERATION 50 mana per charge ⇒ 75 mana per charge
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Masteries
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Feast
				
				
					Cooldown increased.
				
				
					Feast has become the poster child for conservative gameplay. Access to this sustain has crowded out the riskier mastery options at that level (namely Double-Edged Sword), making it hard for lane bullies to succeed at forcing weaker laners back to the fountain. Limiting Feast to one proc per wave tones down the impact it has on lane while keeping its heal amount satisfying.
				
				
					COOLDOWN 25 seconds ⇒ 30 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Secret Stash
				
				
					Gives less health but more mana.
				
				
					You can probably write this patch note on your own. Using abilities more in lane: good. Sustaining effortlessly through lane: bad. Biscuit is another place to drive that home. Corrupting Biscuit.
				
				
					INSTANT BISCUIT HEALTH 20 ⇒ 15
				
				
					INSTANT BISCUIT MANA 10 ⇒ 15
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Grasp of the Undying
				
				
					Less health and damage.
				
				
					If you’ve spent some time in top lane during Season 6, you’ve seen Grasp of the Undying again, and again, and again (there’s an Ekko joke somewhere in here). We have nothing against a tank mastery being strong on tanks, but not only is the level of sustain making tanks immovable in lane, the damage turns them from CC bots to killing machines. Who are still CC bots.
					This change probably won’t solve Grasp’s problems on its own, but we want to at least tone it down while we continue exploring our options.
				
				
					HEALTH STEAL 3% maximum health ⇒ 2.5% maximum health
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Spell Shields
		
	
		
			
				
					It’s well-known that spell shields can block multiple abilities that hit at the exact same time - basically, spell shields protect you for a tiny window of time, regardless of what hits you in that moment. This window is very slightly inconsistent depending on server refresh rates. Combined with the fact that certain spells in our game (like Corki’s R - Missile Barrage) are broken into multiple sections code-side, this means that on rare occasions, some part of these ‘multi-hit’ abilities falls on the wrong side of the refresh and ‘goes through’ spell shields. We’ve refactored the window to be consistent so this shouldn’t happen anymore.
				
				
					SPELL IT OUT Fixed a bug where certain abilities could pop a spell shield and still take effect.
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Store Visual Refresh
		
	
		
			
				
					We’re updating the League store later this patch with a visual refresh, which should help it look more like the rest of the client. The most noticeable change is the navigation bar moving from its old spot on the left side of the store to the top.
				
				
					NEW LOOK The League store has been updated to look more like the rest of the client
				
				
					STREAMLINED The navigation bar has fewer categories
				
				
					GAMEPLAY Access this menu for runes and boosts
				
				
					ACCESSORIES Ward skins, summoner icons, and Hextech chests and keys live here.
				
				
					BUTTONS RP purchase, gifting, and account (name changes, server transfers) buttons can be found on the right side of the navigation bar

					This patch, we've got changes in to address a few straggling concerns, including the return of the See More Stats panel! (Rest in peace, See More Stats graphs.)
				
				
					MISPLACED MASTERIES Fixed a bug where viewing another player's masteries when a New Champion Select queue popped caused you to lose access to your own masteries

					Spellcasting defaults to Quick Cast with Range Indicators. Saved settings are unaffected.
				
				
					As a reminder, Quick Cast with Range Indicators makes it so that on key press, an ability’s range indicator appears, and on key release, it fires. This setup’s proven to be the most intuitive for new players, but required multiple changes in the options menu to get to (which can be overwhelming when you’re trying to learn everything). We removed that roadblock last patch by adjusting settings defaults, anticipating new players would get the desired win while existing players wouldn’t notice since the change doesn’t modify existing account settings.
					...Turns out we underestimated how frequently “Restore Defaults” is still used, especially in PC cafes, and a lot of you chalked the change up to a settings bug. So, we’re here now to explain our reasoning and confirm that this is indeed intentional.
				
				
					QUICK! Quick cast is now the default setting for all ability and item hotkeys
				
				
					INDICATE! Range Indicators are now enabled by default

		Greetings, Summoners.
		Welcome to Patch 6.7, the one where we drain some extraneous power from some top-tier picks and buff Irelia. We’d make a joke about buffing / nerfing Irelia, but the cold, hard fact is that as of this month we are net neutral on Irelia changes across four years. Morello would be proud.
		Zooming out from our mountain observatory (fun fact: each patch is written in a discrete and exotic locale), the big focus for this seemingly light set of balance changes is extraneous power. Unlike some of the other design terms we may highlight in patch notes, this one’s pretty self-explanatory. It’s power.
		That’s extraneous.
		Sass aside, the removal of extraneous power speaks to one of our guiding philosophies - that is: where possible we like to preserve a champion’s strengths and open up their weaknesses instead. But what if a champion has too many strengths? Sometimes we have champions that are good at a lot of things - that’s okay! But when, say, Poppy has best-in-class durability, crowd control, damage, and utility for a tank… something’s gotta give.
		So as you read through the usual buffs and nerfs below, try to keep in mind that there is such a thing as being too good at too many things (at least in League of Legends. We’ve also got some changes to death timers, just in case you ever find yourself losing to a Korean challenger team while you’re ahead ten thousand gold. That situation might sound incredibly specific, but it happens far more often than you’d think.
		And that’s all for this patch! Kick back and enjoy some of those neat rotating game modes, and we’ll see you around the Rift. We’ll be flying across terrain like a celestial dragon, burning your team to death with the beautiful and terrifying energy of newborn stars.
		Good luck, have fun.

			Champions
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Aurelion Sol
				
				
					Q stun duration down. R slow adjusted.
				
				
					Aurelion’s just begun to take flight above the Rift, yet already we’re seeing him become a destructive force once you’re able to harness his starpower. Sol’s mastery curve is steeper than Mount Targon itself, which is understandable given his unique positioning requirements for a mage. Once you’ve appropriately adjusted though, Aurelion starts pumping out damage bigger than his ego (that is to say, things get pretty crazy). We’re pleased that Aurelion’s worth investing the time it takes to learn - we’re just adjusting the immense reward you get for doing so.
				
				
					Q - Starsurge
				
				
					STUN DURATION 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds ⇒ 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds
				
				
					R - Voice of Light
				
				
					SLOW 60/70/80% ⇒ 40/50/60%
				
				
					DURATION 4 seconds ⇒ 2 seconds
				
				
					removedSTAY A WHILE No longer decays over the duration
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Corki
				
				
					Basic attack ratio down.
				
				
					The go-to midlane staple in pro play, Corki’s damage output is too much for his peers to keep up with at the moment. Corki makes sense as a ‘caster-carry’ at heart, using his gold to fuel a barrage of high-damage abilities for poking enemies or laying on the burst after a package power-play. What doesn’t make sense is the guy with top-shelf spells (and hextech munitions) having above-average basic attacks. We’re cutting back on some of that extraneous power (there it is) to bring him in line without infringing on his spell-slinging identity.
				
				
					Passive - Hextech Munitions
				
				
					RATIO ON BASIC ATTACKS 1.1 total attack damage ⇒ 1.0 total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Irelia
				
				
					Q cost down, attack damage ratio up.
				
				
					Irelia’s been struggling overall this season, but most notably she’s underperforming in matchups she should feel good about: ranged champions who struggle against her dive. The high sustain available to those champions has made it harder for her to contest enemy farming in lane, while their general tankiness has left her all-in feeling a bit too weak to finish them off. Irelia has the tools to farm at a distance before diving onto those champions, she just needs a bit more consistency as to how often and how efficiently she can do so.
				
				
					Q - Bladesurge
				
				
					COST 60/65/70/75/80 mana ⇒ 50/55/60/65/70 mana
				
				
					RATIO 1.0 total attack damage ⇒ 1.2 total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Jhin
				
				
					Q cost increased and damage down. E cost down.
				
				
					As audiences have grown familiar with Jhin’s obsession for the dramatic (and the number four), it’s clear that we went too far in addressing his laning woes in 6.4. Now that we’ve finally seen a clear picture of Jhin’s fearsome late-game potential, we’re pulling back to a middle ground where both sides feel like they can meaningfully impact the Virtuoso’s murderous performance.
				
				
					General
				
				
					THIS TOWN AIN’T BIG ENOUGH Fixed a bug where High Noon Jhin was enormous
				
				
					Q - Dancing Grenade
				
				
					DAMAGE 60/85/110/135/160 ⇒ 50/75/100/125/150
				
				
					COST 30/35/40/45/50 mana ⇒ 40/45/50/55/60 mana
				
				
					E - Captive Audience
				
				
					COST 40/45/50/55/60 mana ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50 mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kindred
				
				
					W heal down early but up late. R is now self-cast.
				
				
					Champion complexity is valuable, but sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Experienced Kindred players are too able to optimize the value they get around placing and navigating their two zones (Wolf’s Frenzy and Lamb’s Respite). Cutting back on Wolf’s Frenzy’s sustain softens Kindred’s early game dominance in experienced hands, while centering Lamb’s Respite limits their capacity to save mispositioned allies (while benefitting newer Kindreds thanks to solving some of the targeting-wonkiness).
				
				
					W - Wolf's Frenzy
				
				
					PASSIVE HEAL 43-94 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 34-102 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					R - Lamb's Respite
				
				
					CAST PARADIGM Now self-casts directly on top of Kindred (can no longer be placed on allies)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Lissandra
				
				
					This is a buff to prettiness and sass.
				
				
					I WHIP MY HAIR Lissandra’s hair braid now moves realistically on her base and all skins!
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Lux
				
				
					W missile speed up.
				
				
					We’re pretty happy with how 6.6’s changes to Prismatic Barrier are playing out, but it seems we went a little too far in hampering Lux’s personal safety. This change won’t affect its use on allies all that much, but should make firing your shield and running away from danger feel more responsive.
				
				
					W - Prismatic Barrier
				
				
					THROWBACK Prismatic Barrier is slightly slower as it goes out, but is much faster on return (overall faster from 6.6)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Nidalee
				
				
					W damage down early, up later.
				
				
					We changed Nidalee last patch with the goal of reducing her dominance in the jungle for high-level players, but introduced a compensatory boost to Pounce’s damage in the event that we went too hard. In reality, the opposite occurred - Nidalee actually improved as people adapted to the changes. While we’re happy to hear she’s able to succeed, we’re slightly dialing back on Nid’s clear speed to give other junglers a chance to shine.
				
				
					W - Pounce
				
				
					DAMAGE 65/110/155/200 ⇒ 60/110/160/210
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Poppy
				
				
					Passive and E range down. Q damage down. Passive doesn’t reset basic attacks.
				
				
					Reworked to be a disruptive tank that lives in the middle of a battle, Poppy excels at peeling threats and blocking divers and assassins from getting to her precious, precious carries. Poppy currently boasts some of the highest damage, crowd control and overall reliability for a tank in the League, leaving teams hard-pressed to pass her up no matter what the composition demands. When looking at which of these areas to pull power from, we landed on range as the biggest offender contributing to Poppy’s over-the-top strength.
					When you combine high base damage and no shortage of tools to lock down a single target, you end up with a tenacious threat that simply ignores what the other team wants to do and dives the highest profile targets over and over. We love Poppy being a sturdy threat to anything within reach, but limiting her access to the back lines of a fight keeps her in the middle of the chaos where she’s meant to thrive - or at the very least, undergo significantly more risk to pull off the same CC chains she’s used to.
				
				
					Passive - Iron Ambassador
				
				
					RANGE 525 ⇒ 425
				
				
					removedSHIELDY:: No longer resets Poppy’s basic attack
				
				
					Q - Hammer Shock
				
				
					DAMAGE 40/65/90/115/140 + 6% of the target’s maximum health ⇒ 35/55/75/95/115 + 7% of the target’s maximum health
				
				
					E - Heroic Charge
				
				
					RANGE 525 ⇒ 425
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Rammus
				
				
					R cooldown up.
				
				
					Whenever a champion starts seeing play in a different role or building different items than predicted, we have to ask ourselves a few important questions. ‘Is this champion still making appropriate trade-offs?’ While Rammus trades sonic-speed ganks so he can brawl with the best in the top lane, the strength and repeatability of his all-ins make it near-impossible for enemies to come out ahead in any situation. We’re cracking down on the armordillo’s uptime to make fighting Rammus in lane more realistic.
				
				
					R - Tremors
				
				
					COOLDOWN 60 seconds ⇒ 100/80/60 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Soraka
				
				
					Q and W’s mana costs increased.
				
				
					Our hopes with Soraka’s latest changes were twofold - cut down on the frustrations of her being a non-interactive backline healer while keeping her overall performance about the same. We’re confident we accomplished the first objective (Raka’s taking more risks to spread the love), but she came out a bit stronger than we’d hoped for. We were intentionally soft when tuning Soraka’s costs so players could play around the new Starcall paradigm, but now that folks have adapted, we’re making her consistent output more reasonable during longer fights.
				
				
					Q - Starcall
				
				
					COST 40 mana at all ranks ⇒ 40/45/50/55/60 mana
				
				
					W - Astral Infusion
				
				
					COST 40/45/50/55/60 mana ⇒ 50/55/60/65/70 mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Udyr
				
				
					Health regen down. R’s damage on-hit and damage over time down.
				
				
					Udyr’s strong early game dueling combined his high clear speed leaves you with a bit of a catch-22: fight him and lose or leave him alone and let him scale. On top of that, Udyr sustains through most damage taken in the jungle, allowing him to spend most of the game fighting - monsters or other champions - without ever having to base. Much like Shyvana last patch, we don’t want to prevent Udyr from reaching his late game fantasy, we just want to ensure it takes a reasonable amount of time for him to do so. Throttling down the efficiency with which he can bring home the bacon should give opposing teams more time to do something about it.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE HEALTH REGEN 8.7 ⇒ 6
				
				
					R - Phoenix Stance
				
				
					DAMAGE PER SECOND 15/25/35/45/55 ⇒ 10/20/30/40/50
				
				
					PROC DAMAGE 40/75/110/145/180 ⇒ 25/60/95/130/165
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Zed
				
				
					W cooldown increased. W’s bonus attack damage passive decreased.
				
				
					From laning to late-game, Zed’s dominating every phase of the game. Zed’s a challenging opponent at all skill levels, but key among the frustrations of dealing with him is the safety at which he operates. Be it long-ranged, dual-shuriken action or a clean getaway, the window Zed presents to interact with him is on the shorter side when compared to the duress he places upon his victims. Widening the gaps between Zed’s aggression and taking out some of his back-loaded scaling (now that he’s got access to some sweet items) will bring careful opponents closer to victory and further from being styled on in someone’s highlight reel.
				
				
					W - Living Shadow
				
				
					COOLDOWN 18/17/16/15/14 seconds ⇒ 22/20/18/16/14 seconds
				
				
					PASSIVE BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE 5/10/15/20/25% ⇒ 4/8/12/16/20%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Global Splash Unification
				
				
					Updating old splash arts to be the same in all regions. Part one of several.
				
				
					Splash art is one of most important things we have for conveying a champion's fantasy and personality in League. Splashes are used everywhere: from champ select to the loading screen, portrait icons, the store, and more recently Hextech Crafting. Many of our oldest splash arts are different across the world, meaning those champs and skins have vastly divergent representations of their fantasy and feel, depending on which region you play League in.
					While the long-term plan has always been for us to create brand new art for these older pieces, we’re doing some short term work over the next few patches to unify the global experience: some of our splashes will be switching to the Chinese version, and vice versa. We know that in some cases, the quality may still be low or the art style may still be off. Like last year’s Mass Texture Rebalances, this is not a replacement for full-scale splash updates down the road, just a short term solution to solve a specific problem.
					The following splash arts have been modified, or replaced with the Tencent version (apologies for the wall of text):
				
				
					Ahri - Blitzcrank
				
				Dynasty Ahri, Midnight Ahri, Crimson Akali, Silverfang Akali, Stinger Akali, Cowboy Alistar, Almost Prom King Amumu, Emumu, Re-Gifted Amumu, Vancouver Amumu, Annie in Wonderland, Prom Queen Annie, Boom Boom Blitzcrank
					
				
					Caitlyn - Hecarim
				
				Arctic Warfare Caitlyn, Safari Caitlyn, Gentleman Cho'Gath, Red Baron Corki, Toxic Dr. Mundo, Masquerade Evelynn, Shadow Evelynn, Spectral Fiddlesticks, Hextech Galio, Sanguine Garen, Desert Trooper Garen, Hillbilly Gragas, Base Hecarim
					
				
					Irelia - Kennen
				
				Base Irelia, Infiltrator Irelia, Hextech Janna, Tempest Janna, Dragonslayer Jarvan IV, Temple Jax, Sakura Karma, Sun Goddess Karma, Base Karthus, Grim Reaper Karthus, Phantom Karthus, Statue of Karthus, Unmasked Kayle, Swamp Master Kennen
					
				
					LeBlanc - Morgana
				
				Wicked LeBlanc, Acolyte Lee Sin, Traditional Lee Sin, Ionian Master Yi, Samurai Master Yi, Headhunter Master Yi, Cowgirl Miss Fortune, Road Warrior Miss Fortune, Secret Agent Miss Fortune, Waterloo Miss Fortune, Lord Mordekaiser, Exiled Morgana, Sinful Succulence Morgana

			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Maw of Malmortius
				
				
					Magic resist down. Attack speed removed.
				
				
					Hexdrinker’s always been an effective pick-up for those looking to defend against magic damage spikes, but Maw’s stealing the show in 2016. Warming the bench in previous seasons (often something you upgraded if you ‘had to’), Maw’s raw stat-efficiency combined with the upgraded Lifegrip buff currently makes it a catch-all for any magic damage, rather than a counter to a specific situation. Maw should still feel like an appropriate upgrade against mage-heavy teams, but rushing it suboptimally shouldn’t be as effective as it currently is.
				
				
					MAGIC RESIST 50 ⇒ 40
				
				
					removedLIFELINE ATTACK SPEED 25% ⇒ 0%

			Masteries
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Warlord's Bloodlust
				
				
					Ranged champions lifesteal less from minions.
				
				
					Staying in lane is about weighing your rewards vs. what you’re risking to get them. Pushing allows you to apply heavy pressure on the turret, but increases the risk of over-extending and getting ganked. Trading damage increases your chances of getting a kill, but the same is true for getting killed.
					By design, Warlord’s Bloodlust sets up a simple risk vs. reward proposition: by opening yourself up to additional lane harassment and gank pressure, you can push the lane aggressively to be rewarded with the sustain to shrug off that damage. Fail to do so (that is, taking too much harassment while you push), and you’re forced to sit back to sustain your health. This is true for melee champions taking Warlord’s Bloodlust. By contrast, ranged champions are able to avoid much of that risk by virtue of getting all of their sustain from a safe distance. We’re tweaking that.
				
				
					EFFECTIVENESS VS MINIONS 50% ⇒ 50% for melee champions, 25% for ranged champions
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Death Timers
		
	
		
			
				
					Shorter death timers in mid-game.
				
				
					Death Timers are but a single piece of the overall game-flow puzzle, but it’s clear they’re just too punishing in the mid-game. We still want teams to be appropriately rewarded for winning teamfights as the game progresses, but this should pull back on the feeling of tense, strategic matches ending abruptly off a single mistake.
					Unless you lose a teamfight inside your base. Then you were just asking for it.
				
				
					CAN I LIVE? Rebalanced Death Timers to be less punishing between minutes 30 and 55 (Timers before and after these points are unchanged).

			Vision
		
	
		
			
				
					We’ve all been there. You’re setting up an ambush on the enemy team. You’re waiting for them to just pass the corner so you can jump on them… only to be hit by a skillshot and murdered viciously. “But this wasn’t warded - how did they see me?”, you might ask. Well, thanks to a previous system there were often tons of cases where ‘line-of-sight’ (as we think of it) wasn’t giving both of you a fair deal. We’re changing some vision rules under-the-hood to clean up these interactions to let our sneakier, more devious players run free. Generally speaking, aside from brush / vision reducing effects, if you can see them - they see you. If you don’t see them, they don’t see you. It’s that easy.
					We’re aware that changes to major systems like vision can cause a few bugs, so we’ve taken to task fixing some of the biggest offenders surrounding this particular interaction. We’re not claiming all vision problems have been fixed, but you can rest easy knowing that your clever machinations of ‘hiding behind a corner’ won’t be foiled by bugs any time soon.
				
				
					Wards, though. Those’ll get you every time.
				
				
					NOW YOU SEE ME If you can see an enemy champion without the assistance of wards or vision effects, they can always see you and vice-versa (Graves’ Smokescreen or other vision reducing effects aside)
				
				
					NOW YOU DON’T Fixed a bug where killing a blue trinket would reveal the area around you for a short period of time
				
				
					YOU SET ME UP Fixed a bug where attacking an enemy champion near a wall could give them vision over that wall

			Rotating Game Mode Queue
		
	
		
			
				
					On weekends, new game modes will be available for play.
				
				
					Rotating game modes provide unique spins on the classic League formula. We’re introducing a queue that’ll bring the alternative action on weekends with a suite of familiar game modes and maybe a fresh face or two.
					Ascension is up first, starting this Friday! Learn more in the release announcement.
				
				
					WEEKEND WARRIORS The Rotating queue is available starting on Friday afternoon around 4 PM server time and closes up shop very early Monday morning
				
				
					BECAUSE IT ROTATES, SEE The Rotating Game Mode queue offers at least one game mode per weekend over several weeks
				
				
					SPIN CYCLE We’ll publish a schedule of upcoming modes on Leagueoflegends.com before they’re available to play
				
				
					FLEXIBLE MASTERY Champion Mastery is available in all Rotating queue game modes, allowing you to earn points for champs you play as well as enabling Hextech Crafting chest drops for S scores and the chance at key fragments for wins

			Premade Limiter
		
	
		
			
				
					Tightening premade skill gap limits at the top of the ranked ladder.
				
				
					At the top of the ladder the wide skill variance of players makes the existing premade limiter rules less effective at ensuring players are constructing premades the matchmaker can handle fairly. Up until this point we allowed Diamond V players to play with Challengers but we’re tightening the dynamic queue requirements to ensure fair premades are being composed. This also closes a loophole where players could queue with a Diamond V smurf for easier games at the top of the ladder.
					Here’s how premade limiter will work now:
				
				
					TOP-OF-LADDER PREMADE LIMITER Challenger, Master, and Diamond players can now only queue up for ranked matches with players within +/- 2 divisions of them. Master and Challenger are each counted as single divisions above Diamond. Examples of the new bands in practice:
				
				
					CHALLENGER Challenger / Master / Diamond I
				
				
					DIAMOND I Challenger / Master / Diamond I, II, III
				
				
					DIAMOND V Diamond III, IV, V / Plat I, II
				
				
					PLATINUM High-Platinum players can queue with low-Diamond players based on the Diamond players’ restrictions above. All Platinum players can still queue with Platinum (and Gold) players of any division.
				
				
					GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE Unaffected

			Hextech Crafting and Loot Update
		
	
		
			
				
					Key fragment drops will be enabled on ARAM and Twisted Treeline during this patch.The top loot tiers now have names for easier identification.
				
				
					As some of you have experienced, key fragments weren’t dropping after ARAM or Treeline wins. They will be during this patch cycle. Go forth and unlock things.
				
				
					A BOX WITHOUT LOCKS Key fragments now have a chance of dropping after winning ARAM or Twisted Treeline games
				
				
					DROPRATE MURPHYS For the min maxers out there, we’ve tuned the drop rates to be the same across game modes based on a number of factors such that it’s not easier to earn fragments in any specific mode even though game lengths are shorter.

		Greetings, summoners.
		Welcome to patch 6.6, the one where we buff Kha’Zix. There’s lot of other changes, but this one goes out to all you Bug Catchers out there. Oh, and there’s a space dragon if you’re into that sort of thing. Maybe you’ve heard of him. He’s kind of a big deal.
		Rather than hammering in all of our changes, we figured we’d shop around for some better ideas on how we want to talk about some of our more outrageous outliers. While 6.6’s got a lot going on, let’s highlight the ones getting the most love: a group we’ll refer to as specialists. These champions are the strategic role-players - the niche pick flavor packets that bring a whole lot of intention to the team composition noodle bowl(or maybe they’re the ones creating a strategy stew all their own). What we’re trying to say (aside from being hungry), is that these specialists have very high strengths that often define a team’s strategic identity. In exchange, however, they typically have stark weaknesses that can be capitalized upon. This is where the generalists we were talking about last patch come in: with their subtler weaknesses (and strengths), generalists usually serve to enhance the flavor of the specialist without also introducing additional tastes.
		Food talk aside, we’ve got the usual buffs and nerfs below, but we’ve also shifted more of our focus to the pro scene, as we begin taking a deeper look at what’s causing such slow starts. As such, you won’t see any changes to death timers or early towers/dragons (yet), but we’re not turning a blind eye to the woes of the pros just yet. Consider this patch us dipping our toes into the pool before diving in head-first.
		And that’s all for us this patch! We look forward to seeing how you spice up your team-composition dishes, be it through a Shock Blast of poke-sicles, Salted Mantras, or simply turning back time and trying all over again. Whatever champion stew we’re brewing, you can count on it tasting like fear.
		Good luck, have fun.

					Alistar
				
				
					E's healing on allies down.
				
				
					Oh, Alistar. Your amazing peel and engage are rivaled only by your sustain, yet one of these things does not belong. While it’s important to Alistar to be able to regenerate health between trades (he puts the Ali in All in), his high mana regeneration paired with the effectiveness of his Headbutt/Pulverize combo make him the optimal choice in pro play, no matter what your team needs. We’re focusing these changes around a single decision point - which does he value more? Engage potential, or sustain? Constraining the efficiency at which Alistar can heal his allies means that his lane buddies will have to carefully consider what the situation calls for, or risk not having enough health to engage when he does.
				
				
					E - Triumphant Roar
				
				
					HEAL AMOUNT FOR ALLIES 50% ⇒ 33%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Azir
				
				
					Soldiers no longer apply Fervor of Battle.
				
				
					So this interaction was removed in 6.5, but slipped our patch notes. While Azir’s soldiers look like they’re basic attacking, they’re not applying on-hits. Sand Soldier attacks are treated as spells, and as such, apply spell effects like Liandry’s Torment or Rylai’s Crystal Scepter. For people that knew how this interaction worked (for as long as it did), Azir could actually be dealing more physical damage than magic. That’s not a particular can of ascended worms we’re willing to balance around - on top of the fact that this shouldn’t work anyways - so it’s gone.
				
				
					General
				
				
					SETTLE DOWN Sand Soldiers no longer apply Fervor of Battle (removed in 6.5)
				
				
					HOLD YOUR GROUND Fixed a bug where Azir would automatically start moving after issuing a Sand Soldier attack command
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Cho'Gath
				
				
					R stacks provide more health.
				
				
					Cho’Gath isn’t far below the bar, but life’s still hard for a void dinosaur-terror with lobster claws. Cho’Gath has the power to wreck an entire team given his powerful CC… or die horribly, beginning an almost never-ending game of catchup to restore the health stacks he so desperately relies on to function. We’re easing up on the build-up (especially late-game) for a voidbeast fallen on hard times.
				
				
					R - Feast
				
				
					BONUS HEALTH PER STACK 90/120/150 ⇒ 100/140/180
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Ekko
				
				
					Passive speed duration up. E cooldown reduced.
				
				
					Ekko specializes in creating high moments through big engages and risky dives, but his time has passed - falling short compared to his counterparts in almost every lane and role. Strengthening Ekko’s ‘hit-and-run’ gameplay gives him more power to follow through on the kill pressure he creates during early skirmishes.
				
				
					Passive - Z-Drive Resonance
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 40/50/60/80% (at levels 1-16) ⇒ 50/60/70/80% (at levels 1-16)
				
				
					E - Phase Dive
				
				
					COOLDOWN 13/11.5/10/8.5/7 seconds ⇒ 11/10/9/8/7 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Fiora
				
				
					Passive deals less damage, but scales higher early. E slow and range down.
				
				
					Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a high-damage carry champion builds primarily tank items and still manages to deal enough damage to duel everyone while being impossible to take down. It’s a problem as old as League itself, but these days Fiora’s become the posterchild for game health issues when Tanks and Carries cross the streams. It’s a standard problem, but also one that’s often misunderstood - it’s not the damage that Fiora (or any carry) does, it’s the whole ‘not making a tradeoff to get it’ that’s an issue.
					Mixing up the bases and scaling goes a long way to making sure the die-hard full damage Fioras out there still get to carve up opponents with skilled play. That said, this fencer’s still got problems even before we start talking items, which is what the other half of this changelist is addressing. Right now, Fiora’s wealth of tools to activate Duelist’s Dance are so slanted in her favor that it doesn’t feel graceful or elegant (or possible) to deny her the satisfaction of striking your weak spot. We’re cleaning up some of her advantages there to make Fiora’s 1v1’s more compelling than ‘instantly proc 3 vitals - now see if you can deny me the last one.’
				
				
					Passive - Duelist's Dance
				
				
					BASE TRUE DAMAGE 3% of the target's maximum health ⇒ 2% of the target's maximum health
				
				
					RATIO 2.8 - 4.5% per 100 bonus attack damage ⇒ 4.5% per 100 bonus attack damage
				
				
					E - Bladework
				
				
					SLOW 40/45/50/55/60% ⇒ 30%
				
				
					BONUS RANGE 50 ⇒ 25
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Janna
				
				
					E bonus damage and R disable time down.
				
				
					From a holistic, top-level view of League, Janna’s role as a protector fits rather well into the eternal rock-paper-scissors of ‘tank-carries-assassins’. The issue (as is always the case whenever Janna’s too strong) is how well she can protect. At present, Janna’s strengths are shutting down not just divers and assassins, but almost any aggressor there is. We’re pulling back on some of the extraneous power she provides when enabling counter-engages while ensuring her ‘keepaway’ style of disengage is intact.
				
				
					E - Eye Of The Storm
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE ON SHIELD 14/23/32/41/50 ⇒ 10/17.5/25/32.5/40
				
				
					R - Monsoon
				
				
					DISABLE DURATION 0.75 seconds ⇒ 0.5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Jayce
				
				
					Hammer Q's cost reduced. Base damage and ratio increased.
				
				
					Another niche pick, Jayce has been on the cusp of widespread play for a while now. We’re not touching his poke where he’s already a strong contender, but tuning up Jayce’s ability to follow-up that poke (or create lane presence) with a hammer.
					To the face.
				
				
					Q - To the Skies!
				
				
					COST 40/45/50/55/60 mana ⇒ 40 mana at all ranks
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 30/70/110/150/190/230 ⇒ 40/80/120/160/200/240
				
				
					RATIO 1.0 bonus attack damage ⇒ 1.2 bonus attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kalista
				
				
					Less attack speed unless near Kalista's Oathsworn. W damage and sentinel laps down. R's pull range down.
				
				
					We’ve talked in previous patches about Kalista’s competing identities, and with her dominating professional and normal play alike, we’re going to revisit that concept. In the past, we’ve struggled to reconcile Kalista’s teammate-focused oathsworn gameplay with her independent ‘hop around and spear everyone to death’ carry fantasy. Having multiple strengths is fine, but in the case of Kalista - ‘I’m incredible at 2v2’ (thanks to Fate’s Call) and ‘I’m incredible 1v1’ run counter to one another, making it hard for teams to know how or even when to fight back.
					These changes are all about letting Kalista have the best of both worlds - but only if she’s near her Oathsworn. Pair the greater emphasis on their bond with a general reduction of power on some more extraneous mechanics means Kalista and her ally will need to be more in sync than ever to achieve the same dominance.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.694 ⇒ 0.644
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED GROWTH STAT 2.8% ⇒ 2.5%
				
				
					W - Sentinel
				
				
					SENTINEL LAPS 7 ⇒ 3
				
				
					PASSIVE DAMAGE 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% of the target's maximum health ⇒ 5/7.5/10/12.5/15% of the target's maximum health
				
				
					newNEVER LETTING GO Now passively grants Kalista 9-27% bonus attack speed (based on her level) whenever she's near her Oathsworn
				
				
					R - Fate's Call
				
				
					CAST RANGE FROM OATHSWORN 1400 ⇒ 1100
				
				
					OATHSWORN DASH RANGE 1200 (unchanged)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Karma
				
				
					Mantra shield's base and ratio increased.
				
				
					In an ecosystem where scaling supports are all the rage, Karma’s relative underperformance is a worrying trend. While Lulu and Lux transition strong gold leads to significant team utility, Karma’s unable to generate similar value, even when given her whole team’s resources. Her ‘strong early, weak late’ curve indicates Karma’s supportive scaling isn’t where it needs to be to merit consideration, so we’re adding some Sae to really make her Eleisa Tera Vi (yes, that’s a mantra joke).
				
				
					E - Defiance (Mantra)
				
				
					SHIELD AMOUNT 30/90/150/210 ⇒ 30/100/170/240
				
				
					RATIO 0.3 ability power ⇒ 0.6 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kha'Zix
				
				
					Q and W cooldowns reduced.
				
				
					Kha’Zix takes more risk than reward these days, despite appearing on the Patch Notes a few times recently. Kay-Z’s a bit of a balancing tightrope - Isolation makes him feast or famine by nature (either dominating a game or sputtering out), but he’s far enough below the line that we’re okay giving him some love. We’re being careful not to flatly increase his burst, but giving him better dueling in extended fights as well as a booster shot to his jungle clear.
				
				
					Q - Taste Their Fear
				
				
					COOLDOWN 3.5 seconds ⇒ 3 seconds
				
				
					W - Void Spike
				
				
					COOLDOWN 10 seconds ⇒ 9 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Lulu
				
				
					W's ability power ratio and ally duration decreased.
				
				
					In many ways, Lulu single-handedly popularized the term ‘flex-pick’. A powerful champion since launch, Lulu’s been a contested champion in professional play across multiple seasons. Her flexibility combined with the raw utility she can pump into her team’s hyper-carry are unique and interesting strategic niches in their own right, but they also combine to make her one of the most comprehensive support generalists of the group. Generally speaking, we’re okay with Lulu occupying this spot, we just want to make her slightly less overwhelmingly viable than “always.” .
				
				
					W - Whimsy
				
				
					RATIO 10% per 100 ability power ⇒ 5% per 100 ability power
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED DURATION 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds ⇒ 3/3.25/3.5/3.75/4 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Lux
				
				
					W gives more benefit if you've been double-hit, but less shield on single-hits. Missile now slower on the way out, faster back in.
				
				
					The mechanics of this can be a bit complicated, so let’s break down what’s happening. Currently, Lux gives a shield for her allies, and then immediately rewrites that shield on return. This means that in a vast majority of cases, you’re only giving one shield - since the first one you gave was refreshed almost immediately. With this change, not only is it easier to actually hit your allies, but they get more benefit when you do! That’s the good news.
					So it’s all pretty good for Lux. Unless you’re the Lux, in which case you now have a worse shield that takes longer to get to you (that’s the bad news). What gives? Well, Lux’s safety, damage, utility and range are all top-notch. Readers of the patch notes may look at that list and say ‘Hey, that’s a lot of strengths’. And you’d be right - rebalancing the shield is our chance to give Lux an actual weakness to all-ins and assassins without removing the reasons to pick her entirely. Now Lux will just have to play a lot more carefully and patiently around those incredible ranges she’s packing if she expects to get the same results as before.
				
				
					W - Prismatic Barrier
				
				
					newIT’S BETTER FOR YOUR ALLIES Refreshes on second hit ⇒ Stacks and refreshes on second hit
				
				
					newIT'S LIKE A BOOMERANG Missile speed is slower on the way out, but accelerates back to Lux faster after reaching max range
				
				
					SHIELD AMOUNT 80/105/130/155/180 ⇒ 50/65/80/95/110
				
				
					RATIO 0.35 ability power ⇒ 0.2 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Maokai
				
				
					Base Magic Resist up, and Magic Resist scaling introduced. Sapling duration up.
				
				
					Maokai’s seen a heavy drop in play since his dominance throughout 2015, surprisingly absent in an environment filled with his other tanky brethren. We’re going easy (as Maokai has a tendency to overcentralize the playing field when too strong), instead focusing on the key areas where he brings utility to his team. It’s also worth noting that Maokai is the last tank left in the game without scaling Magic Resist. It’s a dangerous proposition, but one that we’re embracing as we adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach in the event that this flings Maokai too far from the tree.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE MAGIC RESIST 30 ⇒ 32
				
				
					MAGIC RESIST GROWTH STAT 0 ⇒ 1.25
				
				
					E - Sapling Toss
				
				
					SAPLING DURATION 35 seconds ⇒ 40/45/50/55/60 seconds
				
				
					newTREE’S A CROWD Saplings no longer stack on top of each other. Instead, they shuffle a short distance away from one another.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Master Yi
				
				
					Base damage up, but ratio moved entirely to bonus attack damage.
				
				
					Usually, when a fed Master Yi dominates an entire team it’s a rare occurrence that comes from careful risk management on a really fragile champion. These days, however, Yeezy’s build of choice is almost fully defensive, abusing on-hit synergies to get most of the damage with far less danger to himself. We’re changing up the way Yi scales so that he can still reasonably achieve the same damage thresholds, but he’s gotta give up some safety and reliability to get it.
				
				
					E - Wuju Style
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 10/15/20/25/30 ⇒ 12/19/26/33/40
				
				
					RATIO 0.1/0.125/0.15/0.175/0.2 total attack damage ⇒ 0.25 bonus attack damage at all ranks
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Nidalee
				
				
					Hunting monsters no longer roots them. W's damage increased, but basic attack reset removed.
				
				
					Speaking of champions with lots of strengths and few weaknesses, we come to Nidalee. Nid’s potency in professional leagues around the world is warping diversity to the point that she’s a must-pick or must-ban in most situations, thanks to her incredible versatility and objective control (what scuttle crab?). We’re lowering Nidalee’s ability to run circles around the competition with a lead in pro play without significantly impacting her performance in normal play.
				
				
					Passive - Prowl
				
				
					removedHUNTING SEASON Hunting monsters no longer roots them
				
				
					W - Pounce
				
				
					removedFURY SWIPES No longer resets Nidalee's basic attack
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 50/100/150/200 ⇒ 65/110/155/200
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Orianna
				
				
					Q mana cost down at early ranks.
				
				
					Orianna’s often heralded as one of the most balanced champions in League, but struggles in average play despite this. We’re not looking to increase Ori’s power for pro players significantly (like Faker needs the help), but easing up on the cost of her core ability positioning ability (say that three times fast) should go a long way.
				
				
					Q - Command: Attack
				
				
					COST 50 mana at all ranks ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50 mana
				
				
					ON THE BALL Fixed a bug where Command: Attack had a smaller AP ratio when moved very short distances.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Quinn
				
				
					Q duration reduced and cooldown increased.
				
				
					For anyone that’s laned against Quinn, this change is a bit of a no-brainer. While giving her the ability to shut down long-ranged champions (like Xerath or Jhin) is neat, in reality Quinn just finds the weakest melee champion on the enemy team and controls their ability to contribute. Quinn’s identity is all about hyper-roaming and the flexible pick/pushing potential that comes with that. Quinn’s identity is not making melee champions obsolete - so we’re adjusting.
				
				
					Q - Blinding Assault
				
				
					COOLDOWN 11/10/9/8/7 seconds ⇒ 11/10.5/10/9.5/9 seconds
				
				
					DURATION 2 seconds ⇒ 1.5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Shyvana
				
				
					Q's scaling reduced at early levels.
				
				
					Shyvana’s too strong. So what are we going to do about it?
					While the below changes might not look like much for anyone that’s been mauled by the half-dragon lately, Shyvana is a champion that we define as high-variance. That is to say ‘She’s okay to rampage through a neighboring lane (or village) because Shyvana can’t do that every game’. This isn’t just about risk vs reward or winrates - variance is the other side of the coin of reliability, describing a champion’s spread of being able to achieve certain outputs over time. To break that down, let’s use examples. Amumu can sometimes land 5-man ultimates - or he can whiff entirely - creating a high variance champion. By contrast, let’s look at Kayle’s Righteous Fury. No matter what you do, it’s always going to give you a buff to your range. Does what it says. There’s still some variance at play (was this the right time to use it?), but it’s pretty low-variance overall.
					So what does this have to do with Shyvana? Well, ability usage (input) isn’t the only thing that can be high-variance. Champions that are more linear have variance in their output instead. For every game where Volibear was allowed to speed racer his way to the backline and flip tables, he’s also had games where he’s been kited to the moon and denied every opportunity. Shyvana’s variance comes from ‘was she starved on gold or did she literally eat your entire jungle?’
					For those of you who have fought against Shyvana recently, the answer is almost always ‘she literally ate my entire jungle.’ (And your bottom laners. Sorry you had to find out this way.)
					The below changes (combined with Titanic Hydra’s changes further down) represent our viewpoint that to attack Shyvana’s power level, we have to affect that variance. Lowering her damage in the early stages, especially when dueling champions, should see a stunt in that growth from ‘always on’ to ‘sometimes on’ as her opponents seek to close the gaps in her flame horizon.
				
				
					Q - Twin Bite
				
				
					RATIO 180/185/190/195/200% total attack damage ⇒ 140/155/170/185/200% total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Twisted Fate
				
				
					Underworld skin visuals are more readable. W card picker standardized across skins.
				
				
					Though it might seem appropriate for a card sharp like Twisted Fate to employ underhanded tricks, he shouldn't be relying on hard-to-see visual effects. Underworld Twisted Fate was a triple offender: his cards blended into the environment, were smaller than the other skins', and his Wild Cards spun the wrong way (look at the edge of a card - it's just a line). Skins should be fun, alternative fantasies, not competitive advantages, so we're addressing these issues.
					While we were working on skin consistency, we went ahead and standardized TF's Pick a Card... picker. Unhovered cards are now always darkened, making it easier to follow the active card as it cycles and better communicating the order the cards cycle in.
				
				
					Visual effects
				
				
					GHOST CARDS The readability of Underworld Twisted Fate's visual effects has been brought in line with his other skins (still spooky green!)
				
				
					PICK A HAT The overhead indicator for W - Pick a Card has been standardized for Twisted Fate's base and all skins. The two unhovered cards are now darkened instead of transparent.

			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Enchantment: Runic Echoes
				
				
					Less damage on proc.
				
				
					Runic Echoes is supposed to realize the fantasy of having a scaling AP champion from the jungle, but a disproportionate amount of buyers transition into heavy tank items after the purchase. Echoes into defense items isn’t a build we’re opposed to per se, but the current tuning is more beneficial for tanky champs that can proc it multiple times in a fight.. Mages still have a scaling ‘hit-and-run’ jungle item, but when Nautilus, Amumu, Maokai (and even… Hecarim?!) are buying this to the exclusion of other enchantments, you know there’s a problem.
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 80 ⇒ 60
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Tiamat
				
				
					Recipe changed. Attack damage lowered, but now has passive cleave again.
				
				
					Back in 5.22, the thinking was that by making Tiamat a cheaper item (while still building out of the amazing Pickaxe), we could see it bought for its laning benefits rather than being the item that you power-spiked off of. What we saw was actually the opposite - many laners and junglers (Kha’Zix, Jarvan, Renekton) alike struggled with the pushing or clearing capabilities of the old Tiamat. Now that we’ve lived in a world without Cleave, we’re trading stat-efficiency to bring it back to the people who need it most.
				
				
					RECIPE Pickaxe + Rejuvenation Bead + 175 gold ⇒ Long Sword + Long Sword + Rejuvenation Bead + 350 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 1200 (unchanged)
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 30 ⇒ 20
				
				
					new?TAKE IT OR CLEAVE IT Now passively cleaves nearby enemies for 20-60% total attack damage (based on distance) on basic attack
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Ravenous Hydra
				
				
					Build path is less ugly.
				
				
					With the lower attack damage on Tiamat, we realized we could make the build smoother by subbing out the Long Sword for a Pickaxe.
					So we did that.
				
				
					RECIPE Tiamat + Vampiric Scepter + Long Sword + 1050 gold ⇒ Tiamat + Vampiric Scepter + Pickaxe + 525 gold
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Titanic Hydra
				
				
					Attack damage down.
				
				
					If you’re someone that plans on basic attacking in League of Legends, Titanic Hydra has a lot of upside. Health scaling on-hit damage, waveclear and a basic attack reset? (Shen nods silently in approval) It also has a lot of attack damage for such a bulky item, making it the better purchase for champions looking to burst you down than its ravenous counterpart. Tuning down the stats to be less appealing as a ‘generalist damage item’ means we can retain Titanic’s unique effects for the tanks that rely on it to become relevant threats.
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 50 ⇒ 35
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Zz'rot Portal
				
				
					Less armor and magic resist. Portals give more gold to enemies and now have ward health.
				
				
					Ah, Zz’Rot. While always seen a silly niche item, you eventually fought your way into our inventories. And then our lanes. And then all of our lanes, as it turns out. Zz’Rot’s intended to fill a strategic role, allowing teams to reactively opt-in to pushing when the situation calls for it (or proactively layer on an already push-heavy comp). Lately though it’s all been ‘stats first, strategy second’ for Zz’Rot buyers, warping regular and pro play alike. We’re focusing the item less on stat-lines and more on your ability to place and protect your portals.

			Hextech Crafting & Loot Update
		
	
		
			
				
					Hextech Annie has been added as loot. Regional system rollout continues.
				
				
					First off, we'll quickly mention we're aware of a bug where key fragments aren't dropping after matchmade Treeline or ARAM wins. Fixing that is on our list of things that need to be done before we can consider Hextech Crafting fully launched, and we're working on a solution for an upcoming patch.
					That aside, we've added the exclusive Hextech Annie skin to Hextech Crafting!
				
				
					OMNI ESSENCE Like other skins, a Hextech Annie skin shard can be combined with the appropriate amount of orange essence to unlock her permanently
				
				
					HEXTECH DOESN’T GROW ON TREES Also like other skins, Hextech Annie can very rarely drop as a permanent chests
				
				
					IT TAKES 10 Unlike other skins, Hextech Annie can be forged by combining 10 gemstones!

			Custom Game Invite Bug
		
	
		
			
				
					When 6.6 is released, you may notice a bug where custom game lobbies sometimes forget to show you the invite button. We'll get a fix out ASAP, but in the meantime, you can force the invite button to appear by switching teams. Sorry!
