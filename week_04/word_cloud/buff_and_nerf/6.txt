		Greetings, Summoners.
		We know some of you are still trying to finish the last set of patch notes, but our first set of pre-season follow-up changes is ready to roll out. Keep up!
		League vets may notice we’ve got fewer immediate pre-season follow-up changes than in previous updates. We haven’t turned a blind eye to things - on the contrary, we’re keeping a close watch on how balance on the Rift is unfolding. That said, this year’s updates look to have made it out of the gate without anything as off as past exceptions, and the majority of changes (both in and out of game) are still settling in.
		Follow-up commentary aside, we’ve got some sweet changes for Shyvana. This is a different type of update than our class updates (Assassins) or large reworks (Yorick). Shyvana didn’t have big problems for us to solve; we wanted to make her better. Jump down for the details, which we won’t summarize here.
		Finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention League’s next Ultimate skin, Elementalist Lux! She’ll be launching some time later this patch, so keep an eye out for Lux’s new look. Looks. There are ten of them!
		Good luck, have fun!

			Elementalist Lux
		
	
		
			
				
					Master the elements with the Elementalist Lux Ultimate skin, arriving on Summoner’s Rift in patch 6.23. The multi-faceted mage will be available for 3250 RP and comes with a set of five new icons. Additional editions will be available at launch, so stay tuned!

					Shyvana
				
				
					Dragon’s Descent can’t be interrupted. E is now an exploding fireball in Dragon Form. Passive resistances down.
				
				
					Shyvana’s one of League’s first opportunistic updates, where a smaller amount of work (compared to big updates) can still yield big improvements. Shyvana’s already a pretty cool champion - we wanted to make her better. We wrote a nifty article about Shyvana’s changes - this context is a simplified summary of it, so if you’ve still got questions, click that link!
				
					Shyvana’s unique strength is that she periodically gets to ignore one of the juggernaut class’s core weaknesses: reliably getting to their targets. Ignoring weaknesses doesn’t help when you’re too behind to flex your strengths, which is why Shyvana has such a hard time clawing her way back from a disadvantage. Broadly speaking, we aimed to give Shyvana more flexibility and help her make better use of juggernaut items. In Dragon Form, Flame Breath’s been redesigned away from a basic damage cone toward something she has more options around using. Dragon Form now gives health instead of resistances, letting her leverage health-scaling items like Titanic Hydra and Sterak’s Gage.
				
					In exchange, we shaved off some mechanics she should still be able to function without. Burnout’s flame trail in Dragon Form asked Shyvana to stay in front of enemies she otherwise wanted in front of her, so we nixed it. We also had to shrink Dragonborn’s resistances based on playtest results, though rather than pure nerfs, we added in a way for her to gain back some resistances if she and her team play the objective game well.
				
				
					Passive - Fury of the Dragonborn
				
				
					BONUS ARMOR & MAGIC RESIST 5/10/15/20 (at levels 1/6/11/16) ⇒ 5 at all levels
				
				
					newDRAGON-HATING DRAGON Shyvana deals 10% more damage to elemental drakes (including Elder Dragon)
				
				
					removedDRAGON SCALES Fury of the Dragonborn's bonuses no longer double during Dragon Form
				
				
					newOTHER DRAGONS' SCALES For each elemental drake Shyvana or her allies defeat, she gains an extra 5 armor and magic resist
				
				
					W - Burnout
				
				
					removedFLAME TRAIL No longer leaves a flame trail behind Shyvana while in Dragon Form
				
				
					newSIZE IN DRAGON FORM 325 (same as Human form) ⇒ 350/365/380 at rank 1/2/3 of Dragon's Descent
				
				
					updatedE - Flame Breath
				
				
					LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY Now stops on the first champion hit (in both Human and Dragon form)
				
				
					RATIO 0.6 ability power ⇒ 0.3 ability power
				
				
					MISSILE SPEED 1700 ⇒ 1575
				
				
					newTHE POWER OF CHOICE While in Dragon Form, Shyvana can target Flame Breath anywhere within its max range
				
				
					newDRAGON FORM EXPLOSION While in Dragon Form, Flame Breath explodes when it hits a champion or reaches its target location, leaving behind a flame zone
				
				
					newDRAGON FORM EXPLOSION DAMAGE 100~200 (at levels 1-18) (+0.3 ability power) magic damage, stacking with Flame Breath's normal damage on all targets hit (not just the first!)
				
				
					FLAME ZONE DURATION 4 seconds
				
				
					FLAME ZONE SIZE 220/240/260 (at ranks 1/2/3 of Dragon's Descent)
				
				
					FLAME ZONE DAMAGE 60~120 (at levels 1-18) (+0.2 ability power) magic damage per second
				
				
					DON'T STAND IN FIRE Enemies that remain in the flame zone are persistently marked for Flame Breath's bonus on-hit damage
				
				
					R - Dragon's Descent
				
				
					newUNSTOPPABLE Shyvana can no longer be knocked out of Dragon's Descent's dash
				
				
					MAX RANGE 950 ⇒ 850
				
				
					DAMAGE 175/300/425 ⇒ 150/250/350
				
				
					newBONUS HEALTH 150/250/350
				
				
					DRAGON FORM ATTACK RANGE 175 ⇒ 175/190/205 at ranks 1/2/3
				
				
					newBIGGER DRAGON Dragon Form is 8/16% larger at ranks 2/3
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Akali
				
				
					Passive AP ratios up. W cost down. E ratios up.
				
				
					Akali’s update was focused around shifting her damage pattern into repeated, telegraphed spikes. We’re happy with how that pattern’s shaken out, but after a little time in the wild it’s clear that those ‘spikes’ of damage aren’t as sharp as they need to be. For Akali to do her job she’s gotta have the potential for lethal damage, so we’re administering a booster-shot to her scalings to keep her damage threatening.
				
				
					Passive - Twin Disciplines
				
				
					HEAL RATIO 0.6 bonus attack damage + 0.3 ability power ⇒ 0.6 bonus attack damage + 0.45 ability power
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.5 bonus attack damage + 0.5 ability power ⇒ 0.5 bonus attack damage + 0.65 ability power
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where damage from Twin Disciplines and Mark of the Assassin would not count towards Thunderlord’s Decree
				
				
					W - Twilight Shroud
				
				
					COST 80/75/70/65/60 energy ⇒ 60/55/50/45/40 energy
				
				
					E - Crescent Slash
				
				
					RATIO 0.7 bonus attack damage + 0.5 ability power ⇒ 0.8 bonus attack damage + 0.6 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Anivia
				
				
					W cooldown lowered. E no longer deals increased damage against targets in R until the storm is fully formed. R forms faster.
				
				
					Anivia’s R-E combo has been a staple of her play for years, but the instant, unavoidable burst and lane pressure it provides overshadows the success Anivia sees from trapping foes in Glacial Storm with well-placed walls and Q stuns. That said, burst damage does seem like a fair reward when Anivia makes use of all the tools available to her. We’re helping her earn her damage payoffs by hastening Glacial Storm’s “cook” time and letting her drop more walls, but giving her less instant gratification.
				
				
					W - Crystallize
				
				
					COOLDOWN 25 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 17 seconds at all ranks
				
				
					E - Frostbite
				
				
					COOLDOWN 5 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 4 seconds at all ranks
				
				
					CHILLED BONUS Deals 200% damage to targets recently hit by Q - Flash Frost or R - Glacial Storm ⇒ a fully-formed R - Glacial Storm
				
				
					R - Glacial Storm
				
				
					TIME TO FULLY FORM 3 seconds ⇒ 1.5 seconds
				
				
					DAMAGE PER SECOND 80/120/160 ⇒ 40/60/80
				
				
					RATIO 0.25 ability power ⇒ 0.125 ability power
				
				
					EMPOWERED DAMAGE Empowered storms deal 150% ⇒ 300% damage (same damage as live)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Evelynn
				
				
					This was getting a little obnoxious.
				
				
					Passive - Shadow Walk
				
				
					removedSHADOW SCREEN No longer displays a grey tint on Evelynn’s screen while camouflaged
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Katarina
				
				
					Stop walking away from your target, Katarina.
				
				
					E - Shunpo
				
				
					SILKY SMOOTH Movement commands are canceled if Shunpo targets a plant or enemy champion
				
			
		
	


		
			
				
				
					Lux
				
				
					Concerns around color-blind readability prompted us to look into Final Spark’s indicator, and we realized it could stand to be easier to read in general.
				
				
					R - Final Spark
				
				
					CLARITY Final Spark’s cast indicator line has been widened to be easier to read
				
			
		
	

	
		
			
				
				
					Malzahar
				
				
					Voidlings deal more damage but don’t multiply as frequently. Malzahar can now store 2 charges of Void Swarm.
				
				
					Love him or hate him, Malzahar’s damage output can be downright confusing. When standing against his Void Swarm, the lack of clarity surrounding how the voidlings operate (and what you should do to fight them) can be more than a little overwhelming. In light of this, we’re adjusting how the mechanic functions to keep things understandable. With a heavier focus on chaining Malefic Visions for voidling success, Malzahar will have to set up minion waves to keep his swarm going - but opponents will have a far easier time stemming the tide by simply killing them. 
				
				
					W - Void Swarm
				
				
					COST 80 mana ⇒ 40 mana
				
				
					newCHARGES Now stores up to 2 charges
				
				
					newVOIDLING HEALTH Voidlings now have three health and take damage similarly to Zyra's plants. Champion basic attacks and spells deal 1 damage (0.25 damage per tick of damage over time effects).
				
				
					VOIDLING PHYSICAL DAMAGE 30/32.5/35/37.5/40% total attack damage ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50 (+0.4 bonus attack damage)
				
				
					VOIDLING MAGIC DAMAGE RATIO 0.1 ability power ⇒ 0.2 ability power
				
				
					SWARMING Voidlings can spawn other Voidlings within 8 seconds ⇒ 3 seconds of W cast
				
				
					removedBURST FROM THEIR CHEST Voidlings no longer spawn other Voidlings by killing minions
				
				
					newBLOOD IN THE WATER Voidlings deal 300% damage to minions affected by Malefic Visions
				
				
					removedMINION HATE Voidlings no longer execute low-health enemy minions
				
				
					removedMOB MENTALITY Voidlings no longer gain 50% attack speed when three or more are active
				
				
					newSLACKERS Voidlings now only gain bonus movement speed toward priority targets if they’re within 600 units of Malzahar
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Orianna
				
				
					We’re reverting a bug we introduced that allowed Orianna to chain her abilities in a way that was too hard to react to. While this is a power-down for Orianna’s maximum overall potential, she’s powerful enough that we’re not looking to compensate right now. (It also helps avoid confusing Orianna players!)
				
				
					W - Command: Dissonance
				
				
					BUGFIX When cast during the travel time of Q - Command: Attack, Command: Dissonance now waits to fire until the ball reaches its destination
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Rengar
				
				
					Sorry, kitty.
				
				
					Bonetooth Necklace
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug causing Bonetooth Necklace to stop working if Rengar was revived through Guardian Angel or Zilean’s R - Chronoshift
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Shen
				
				
					Armor and health growth increased.
				
				
					Shen brings a lot of unique tools that other tanks lack (global teleport, anybody?) but at the moment his base stats are pretty low for the job. His dueling power spikes pretty hard at level 9, thanks to the power of Twilight Assault, but we want to make sure he scales past that into the late game as well.
				
				
					General
				
				
					ARMOR GROWTH STAT 2.6 ⇒ 3.0
				
				
					HEALTH GROWTH STAT 73 ⇒ 85
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Yorick
				
				
					We originally changed Dark Procession’s cast behavior in 6.20 to give Yorick players snappier, more reactive W casts. We knew accuracy would take a small hit, but that tradeoff ended up more problematic than expected. So, we’re reverting the change.
				
				
					W - Dark Procession
				
				
					REVERT Yorick once again walks into range to cast Dark Procession, rather than casting it at max range in the target direction

			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Blade of the Ruined King
				
				
					On-hit damage increased.
				
				
					Blade of the Ruined King has been out of the spotlight for a while, even for champions we expect should like it. Blade of the Ruined King should be the go-to item for basic-attacking champions who want dueling power out of their first item. To accomplish that, it should be doing a bit more at the start of fights.
				
				
					ON HIT DAMAGE 6% of the target’s current health ⇒ 8% of the target’s current health
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Guinsoo's Rageblade
				
				
					No longer loses attack speed on combine.
				
				
					Technically speaking, Rageblade still counts as an attack speed item because of its stacking buff. That said, the loss of the flat value feels like (and often is) a step backward, given that attack speed is necessary to stack Rageblade quickly. As a result, it only feels good to purchase Guinsoo’s if you can supplement it with other attack speed items. We want the Rageblade to feel unconditionally better when you complete it, even if you don’t have other attack speed items.
				
				
					new? ATTACK SPEED 0% ⇒ 25%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Sterak's Gage
				
				
					Sterak’s Gage serves acceptably as a defensive item for fighters who want to start a fight and live to finish it. It’s a smidge weak for its price tag, though, so we’re making it a little easier to pick up.
				
				
					COMBINE COST 1150 gold ⇒ 1050 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2700 gold ⇒ 2600 gold
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Lord Van Damm's Pillager
				
				
					Reminder: Lord Van Damm’s Pillager only exists on Twisted Treeline!
				
					Like Mejai’s Soulstealer, Pillager is meant to be a risky purchase that doesn’t always pan out. Unlike Mejai’s, Pillager is an end-game item that requires a ton of investment to build. Losing control of Treeline’s altars is still a big hit to Pillager’s effectiveness, but its cost is now more appropriate for its baseline strength.
				
				
					COMBINE COST 1000 gold ⇒ 700 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 3300 gold ⇒ 3000 gold

			Summoner’s Rift
		
	
		
			
				
					Living Jungle
				
				
					One patch later, everyone’s still feeling out how the new plants fit into their matches. We’re waiting until players have time to integrate plants into their understanding of the Rift before making big changes, but in the meantime, have some bugfixes!
				
				
					General
				
				
					GREEN THUMB Plants are now immune to critical strikes and lifesteal
				
				
					Blast Cone
				
				
					HORSE PLANT Fixed a bug where Hecarim’s E - Devastating Charge caused Blast Cones to launch him forward instead of backward
				
				
					THEY LOOK SMALL UP HERE Fixed a bug where enemies sometimes flickered out of vision when jumping with a Blast Cone
				
				
					Honeyfruit
				
				
					AGGRESSIVE EATING Fixed a bug where consuming Honeyfruit flagged you as ‘in combat’ for the purpose of various out of combat passives
				
				
					I’LL GET THAT TO GO Fixed a bug where dashing or moving very quickly over Honeyfruit would sometimes fail to pick them up
				
				
					Scryer’s Bloom
				
				
					ANTI-ALLERGY Updated the indicator textures to be less noisy and misleading
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Jungle Experience
				
				
					More XP on mini Krugs, less XP on big Raptor.
				
				
					The time investment we ask of junglers to take the Krugs wasn’t paying off as much as we’d like. As a result, we’re shifting some of the jungle experience from the Raptors to Lesser Krugs. Overall, the amount of experience in the jungle is about the same, but it’s slightly more concentrated in the Krugs.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where you wouldn’t get bonus experience from your jungle item when killing a monster that was a higher level than you while leveling up
				
				
					Raptors
				
				
					CRIMSON RAPTOR EXPERIENCE 65 ⇒ 15
				
				
					Krugs
				
				
					LESSER KRUG EXPERIENCE 5 ⇒ 15 (Ancient Krug and Krug unchanged)

			Teleport & Recall Camera
		
	
		
			
				
					For all those times you get a little caught up in the action off-screen.
				
				
					HEY If Teleport or Recall’s channel is interrupted by someone other than yourself, the camera will now snap to your location

			League Client Update
		
	
		
			
				
					Alpha is officially over and open beta is in full swing!
				
				
					Check out the open beta FAQ for more details.
				
					Performance is our #1 priority. We’re continuing to optimize for performance to ensure a smooth experience for all players while continuing our work to add the remainder of the client’s missing features (like spectator mode, bots in custom games, rotating game modes) over the next few patches.
				
					If you’re having technical issues or bugs are preventing you from enjoying the game experience, know that you still have access to your legacy client. Just click “Launch legacy client” before logging in. You can find solutions to most common issues in the Known Issues section of our support site.
				
				
					New features
				
				
					Below are the major updates for the League client update this patch. Bear in mind that this is not a complete list of everything that was added or changed.
				
				
					newREPLAYS Replays are now enabled in all servers.
				
				
					PUBLIC CUSTOM GAMES Players can now see the list of public custom games that are available.
				
				
					LOOT IMPROVEMENTS Players can now sort and filter their Hextech Crafting inventories.
				
				
					Notable fixes
				
				We’ve revisited default audio levels and improved audio settings in the client. We believe these will address the champion VO levels being super loud in champ select.
					
					This patch will prompt an update to League of Legends desktop icons to correctly display the icon for the client update. You will no longer need to go through the legacy patcher to launch the updated client.
					
					LeagueClient.exe process should no longer remain running after closing the client.
					
					The client should no longer break and appear completely black when a player attempts to start a custom game and another player attempts to quit shortly after.
					
				
	                
				
					Finally, we haven’t forgotten about the alpha summoner icons. If you logged into the updated client prior to Nov 15th, you’ll be receiving your summoner icon by Nov 29th.

			Position Preference
		
	
		
			
				
					Autofill has been enabled in all queues with position preference. There is a low chance that you will receive one of the positions you did not select as primary or secondary (usually support), but queue times will be considerably reduced.
					As before, you are guaranteed to get your primary or secondary position if you’ve recently been autofilled, you recently queued for support or fill, or are in a promo series.
					We have concluded testing position exclusion in LAN and LAS and saw it was negatively impacting queue times, so will not be continuing development on this feature. We’re continuing to experiment with improvements to the whole champion select process.
				
				
					FILL ENABLED Autofill has been enabled in all draft queues at all times

			Bugfixes
		
	
		
			
				Fixed a few bugs where Shaco and LeBlanc clones weren’t properly transferring kill credit to Shaco and LeBlanc themselves (ex. Mejai’s Soulstealer)
					
					Fixed a bug causing Master Yi’s Q - Alpha Strike cooldown to sometimes not display properly
					
					
						E - Playful / Trickster’s damage no longer fires if Fizz dies while on top of his pole
					
					Corrected some scaling information in Kha’Zix’s tooltips
					
					Hextech Protobelt-01’s active can now be properly used during Recall, cancelling the channel
					
					Control Wards no longer put the ‘Disabled’ indicator above Zz’Rot portals (since they don’t actually disable the portals)
					
					Warring Kingdom Katarina’s visual effects have been adjusted to re-add some of the flair lost in her pre-season update
					
					Dunkmaster Darius’s W - Crippling Strike axe backboard flames are no longer offset from the backboard
					
					Dunkmaster Darius’s R - Noxian Guillotine no longer makes an orange blob on the ground when cast on a target with five stacks of Hemmorhage
					
					Tyrant Swain’s W - Nevermove claws no longer wiggle when enemies try to move while rooted
					
					Dark Candy Fiddlesticks’s R - Crowstorm particles no longer show up as Surprise Party Fiddlesticks’s for enemies or spectators
					
					Forecast Janna no longer sometimes plays her joke VO and base Janna’s joke VO on top of each other
					
					Fixed the voiceover effects on Pickpocket, Vandal, and Gangster Twitch’s Recalls
					
					Bloodstone Lissandra’s Recall sound effects now cut off if Recall is interrupted
					
					Atlantean Syndra’s watery Recall sound effects no longer cut off before the channel completes

			With Worlds finished up and ranked concluded, the 2016 season has drawn to a close. Welcome to pre-season.
			From revamping the Ranked system (again), to adding some much-overdue features in Replays and Practice Tool to finally moving the client update to open beta, it’s a year for leveling up all around. We’re hard at work to make a season worth remembering, and that starts right here.
			So what else is on the agenda? The latest in our series of class updates - the Assassins - are prowling the rift, armed to the teeth and ready to parkour across any obstacle to reach their prey. While the Patch Notes have all the info below (and some sweet videos), let’s take a second to talk about the goals. Unlike a full-scale update (like Yorick or Poppy), class updates aren’t targeted at  reinventing characters from the bottom up. They’re for taking a group of champions that feel a little too similar and making them more distinct while improving their overall game health.
			While Assassins may receive top-billing, there are plenty of other gameplay changes in pre-season’s supporting cast. The notes are plenty long on their own, so we’ll let you scour the pages below to learn all about them.
			All in all, pre-season is a time of chaos and change. It’s a tumultuous period where innovators thrive and the only way out is through. So grab an Edge of Night, channel yourself a spell-shield and dive right in. We’ll be tossing daggers right next to you.
			Like we always do about this time - good luck, have fun.

									Talon
								
									
								
									Part of the challenge when undertaking a class update is finding a niche for each champion to fill in an ever-expanding roster, and Talon was no exception. For once in his life, ‘More Blades’ wasn’t an acceptable answer. Instead, we decided to take our cues from the most impressive Talon players out there and really focus on amping what had become an emergent strength of his: roaming. Roaming as a concept can be somewhat evergreen (technically every champion is a roaming champion if you put your mind to it), but when we saw the staggering amount of Talons purchasing Boots of Mobility and running to sidelanes for kills, we set out to embrace the style.
									
									Enter Talon’s newfound obsession with parkour. Thanks to the new Assassin’s Path, we’re letting Talon be the assassin that’s never too far from the fray, providing some seriously impressive gank paths to catch his prey off guard. By giving Talon more opportunities to be at the right place at the right time, we can afford to slow his burst while keeping him an ever-present threat on the map. To the rock-climbers and free-runners of the Rift, this one’s for you.
								
								
									General
								
								
									BASE MOVEMENT SPEED 350 ⇒ 335
								
								
									HEALTH GROWTH STAT 85 ⇒ 90
								
								
									BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 55 ⇒ 60
								
								
									BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.668 ⇒ 0.625
								
								
									ATTACK SPEED GROWTH STAT 2.7 ⇒ 2.9
								
								
									SWIFT STABBING Attack frame improved
								
								
									newPassive - Blade's End
								
								
									Talon’s abilities wound champions and epic monsters for a short duration, stacking up to three times. When Talon basic attacks a fully wounded target, they bleed for a large amount of physical damage over time.
								
								
									DAMAGE 60-160 (+2.0 bonus attack damage) over 2 seconds (at levels 1-11)

									Katarina
								
								
								
									Kat’s truly the embodiment of the phrase ‘feast or famine’; crushing entire fights in a second of button mashing, or throwing limp daggers in a poor attempt to contribute from behind. This has led to a pretty tight leash for Kat’s balance - while you can succeed on her, we’ve had to fine tune every part of her laning to ensure she can’t reliably hit her penta-killing critical mass every game.
								
									This update seeks to remove Kat’s harsh restrictions while also delivering on her lightning-speed high-skill fantasy. Armed with her new Dagger mechanic, Kat’s got the flexibility to orchestrate flashy fights (or smooth getaways) in a way that both she and her opponents can engage with. This lets us ease up on a lot of the base-stat restrictions needed to artificially keep her down, given that Katarina’s opponents always have a clue as to when and how she might move in for the kill.
								
									As a result of the changes, it’s important to talk about one key line below: Katarina can no longer target wards with Shunpo. It’s not a decision that was taken lightly, but a large part of Kat’s update is centered around telegraphing her potential mobility to assailants. Ward-hopping breaks this at a fundamental level - giving her far too many easy outs in tense situations. Kat’s all about finding the right mix of premeditation and reaction in her playmaking, so you’ll have to think on your feet and use all of your tools to survive.

									LeBlanc
								
								
								
									When it comes to identity, Leblanc’s intended to be a fast-paced combo-oriented assassin that uses misdirection and deceit to make her opponent’s heads spin. In reality, however, things play out a little differently. While combos are certainly the name of Leblanc’s game, her largest issue is how little deceiving and misdirecting she actually ends up doing. When your biggest mind-game ability is also the one you double-cast to blow someone up, something’s gotta give.
									
									With her update, we’re letting Leblanc make more tricky plays than ever before. By utilizing Mimic either to create a split-second diversion in the heat of an all-in, or creating a global (!) distraction to fake out unsuspecting side-lanes, your success with LB will depend as much on your creativity as your mechanical skill.

									Rengar
								
								
								
									For all of Rengar’s past history of being frustrated, let’s set one thing straight: we’re actually okay with him leaping on someone and then swiftly murdering them. Rengar’s issue hasn’t been that his assassinations are too effective, rather that his victims have almost no time to react to his attacks. This makes Rengar’s role a binary one - recklessly diving onto targets with no hope of retaliation, or recklessly diving and getting obliterated.
									
									Rengar’s update is focused on leveling out these extremes on both ends of the spectrum. For opponents, this means better awareness of when Rengar’s on the hunt and who he’s got in his sights. For Rengar, this means giving him access to more potent defensive tools so he can live to fight leap another day when things go south. Rengar still rewards patience and awareness, and now he’s got more flexibility to boot.

									As one of our more all-or-nothing assassins, Fizz occupies a tricky spot on the balance spectrum. On one hand, it’s easy for Fizz to feel shut out of a matchup due to his lack of laning tools. On the other, thanks to the effectiveness of using Chum the Waters up close, it’s pretty difficult to avoid Fizz’s all-in when he decides to get frisky. Our changes this patch are aimed at embracing what makes Fizz unique among assassins—best-in-class ranged initiation—while better telegraphing the moments when he’s able to go in for the kill.

									While Kha’Zix’s evolution mechanic promises the ability to tailor your decisions to the game at hand, the balance of power between options has made that promise a difficult one to keep. For pre-season, we’ve retooled KZ’s evolutions by playing up his other unique mechanic: Isolation. While you’re welcome to still just evolve wings first (because it’s sweet), we’re pushing more of Kha’Zix’s power into stalking Isolated targets rather than overwhelming them.

									Passive causes Akali’s next two attacks to heal and deal bonus damage. W teleports Akali to the cast location.
								
								
									If you’ve been keeping up with the Assassin notes so far, you’re probably noticing a pattern - each update contains equal parts ‘how do we make this less frustrating?’ and ‘how do we make this feel cooler?' Akali’s no different. On the subject of making her more unique, we’re playing up Akali’s ‘smoke bomb’ to feel like a more potent defensive tool, giving her more ninja-like ways to juke, dodge, and mindgame her opponents in combat. As for answering that first question, we’re focusing more of her damage in repeatable, telegraphed spikes, ala Mark of the Assassin. We’re not re-inventing the wheel, but Akali’s update should appeal to those patient enough to wait for the right moment to strike.

									Among our assassins, Zed’s the generalist—some stabbing here, a bit of sidelane pressure there—the Master of Shadows does just about everything you want from the role. It’s because of this that he’s been such a balance headache: whenever assassins are good as a class, Zed’s right there to push his knife-wielding brethren out of the spotlight. We’re giving Zed some more differentiation to help inform when you should and shouldn’t consider picking him.
									
									Given his ‘fondness’ for marksmen, we sought to hit two birds with one stone—reducing some of his general power while making him the blade in your arsenal when it comes to dealing with physical damage threats. While Zed will still be potent in the right hands against most team compositions, his true late-game scaling is now dependent not just on how he executes his foes, but who he chooses to mark for death. And how many BF Swords they have.

									Ekko
								
								
									Passive slow removed. R triggers Parallel Convergences that Ekko travels through while Chronobreaking.
								
								
									Unlike many of the champions included in the Assassin Update, Ekko’s changes are just a continuation (albeit a bit more dramatic) of our narrative this season. While Tank Ekko’s been at varying levels of power all year, the key takeaway has been that his pattern, regardless of items, has enough risk that it will always be his best interest to mitigate it. So while these changes don’t aim (or claim) to ‘destroy Tank Ekko once and for all’, they do give damage-focused Ekko builds a more extreme degree of safety from Chronobreak. By allowing AP-focused builds to have a true reset we’re able to cut some of Ekko’s superfluous power and introduce more ways for Ekko to style on you rather than overwhelm you with force.

									R leaves a nest of Jack-in-the-boxes on death. W has more health.
								
								
									While Shaco’s changelist may appear large, the goals are actually very simple: dialing back his extremes. Shaco’s well known for ending games quickly - either by dominating so hard one team surrenders, or failing to convert those beginning minutes and quickly diminishing in effectiveness. We’re reducing the power of Shaco’s frustrating early ganks and translating that power into more utility within skirmishes. By shifting when exactly Shaco can impact a game most, we’re making him more accessible to the average player while letting the trained Shaco mains out there display their dominance (without causing as many broken keyboards).

				Stealth Mechanics
			
		
			
				
					
						Introduction
					
					
						Conceptually, stealth is easy to understand: “you can’t see me.” Mechanically, that means a few things. First, stealth is tied to the vision game: when you don’t know where someone is, there’s a chance they’re closing in on you. This creates both strategic and tactical advantages: for example, Evelynn roaming the map unseen or Wukong getting into initiation range. Second, stealth is a powerful (albeit unwieldy) form of in-combat defense, since stealthed champs can’t be targeted and skillshot aiming becomes rough guesswork.
						
						Across League’s history, we haven’t done a great job of handling these traits separately. Case in point: Vision Wards are the one-size-fits all counter to stealth, regardless of what enemies are trying to do while unseen. To keep things generally balanced, we’ve had to give stealth champions more overall power to offset situations when pink wards shut them down, and that makes them overbearing when wards aren’t in play. There’s simply not enough middle ground. 
						
						Crafting a more refined approach to stealth has implications on multiple parts of the game, and pre-season’s the best time for us to adjust all those levers at once. Make sure to read both this and the Wards section for the complete story!
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Camouflage
					
					
						Longer duration ‘strategic’ stealth. Revealed by proximity, turrets, and Control Wards.
					
					
						The longer duration of Camouflage effects make them ideal for roaming around lanes and the jungle unseen, moving from one victim to the next. Nearby enemies can see through Camouflage, however, making it less reliable in the middle of fights.
					
					
						WHO GOES THERE? Camouflaged champions are revealed by nearby enemy turrets, champions, and Control Wards
					
					
						A SHORT LIST The following stealth abilities are Camouflage effects:
					
					Evelynn’s Passive - Shadow Walk
						
						Rengar’s R - Thrill of the Hunt
						
						Twitch’s Q - Ambush
						
					
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Invisibility
					
					
						Shorter duration ‘tactical’ stealth. Revealed only by turrets.
					
					
						Invisibility effects don't last long enough for users to move from one lane to another, but are well-suited for maneuvering in combat (whether that's to start a fight or reposition within one). Turrets are the only entities that passively see through Invisibility, in line with their nature as safe havens.
					
					
						SOMETHING’S NOT QUITE RIGHT Invisible champions are passively revealed only by nearby enemy turrets
					
					
						A LESS SHORT LIST The following stealth abilities are Invisibility effects:
					
					Akali’s W - Twilight Shroud
						
						Kha’Zix’s R - Void Assault
						
						LeBlanc’s R - Mimic
						
						Shaco’s Q - Deceive
						
						Talon’s R - Shadow Assault
						
						Teemo’s Passive - Guerilla Warfare (formerly “Camouflage”)
						
						Vayne’s R - Final Hour
						
						Wukong’s W - Decoy
						
					
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Shimmer
					
					
						Hitting stealthed units briefly reveals their location.
					
					
						This pre-season, we wanted to create a way to deal with stealth that isn’t just “turn it off.” This new shimmer mechanic is a means of scouting for—and reacting to—stealthed enemies without completely exposing them to retaliation.
					
					
						WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? Damaging an Invisible or Camouflaged enemy (ex. skillshots, area-of-effect abilities, etc) will cause the air around them to shimmer, momentarily revealing their location but not making them targetable or canceling the stealth effect
					
					
						NO DISCOS Champions only shimmer up to once per second, even if they take additional damage during that time
					
				
			
		
		
			Back to top
		
		
				Wards
			
		
			
				
					new
					
						Control Ward
					
					
						Vision Ward update. Reveals Camouflage but not Invisibility. Disables nearby enemy wards.
					
					
						With the addition of the shimmer mechanic as a close(ish)-quarters way to interact with stealth, we felt confident removing Vision Wards from the combat equation. That leaves us with an item that serves one purpose: vision control. (Hence the name change: Control Wards.) With power to spare, we doubled down on the control aspect, and the result is a tool that not only reveals nearby enemy vision, but actively denies it. Controlling indeed.
					
					
						HOW CONTROLLING Control Wards reveal and disable nearby hidden enemy traps and Sight Wards in a 900-unit radius. Camouflaged enemies in the area are also revealed, but Invisible enemies are not.
					
					
						RUDE Control Wards are visible to the enemy team while they’re actively disabling a ward
										
					
						COST 75 gold
					
					
						HEALTH 4
					
					
						WARD LIMIT Each player can have 1 Control Ward on the map and 3 in their inventory
					
					
						WARD VENGEANCE Wards disabled by a Control Ward still grant vision of their attackers while being killed
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					removed
					
						Vision Ward
					
					
						removedA THING THAT EXISTS Vision Wards are now Control Wards—see above!
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Ward Rewards
					
					
						Ward kills grant more experience. Attacking wards no longer proc lifesteal effects.
					
					
						The warding game has always been an important part of League, and that’s only becoming more true this pre-season. From one perspective, this means hunting for wards is its own reward. In another light, however, players are punished for contesting vision as an ‘objective’ since they sacrifice experience and map presence to do so. We’re upping the payoff for ward kills to make it clearer that yes, vision clearing is a thing you should do.
					
					
						Ward experience
					
					
						SIGHTSTONE & TOTEM WARDS 30 experience on kill ⇒ 40 experience on kill
					
					
						CONTROL WARDS 40 experience on kill
					
					
						FARSIGHT WARDS 15 experience on kill ⇒ 20 experience on kill
					
					
						Ward lifestealing
					
					
						With Control Wards no longer nullifying stealth, wards are moving away from in-combat interactions. This change is in line with that direction.
					
					
						removedBLOOD FROM A SIGHTSTONE Attacking wards no longer procs lifesteal or omnivamp effects

				Assassin Itemization
			
		
			
				
					
						Lethality
					
					
						Flat armor penetration has been replaced with Lethality, which scales with target level.
					
					
						Assassins have a snowball problem. When ahead, they’re really ahead, but when behind, they’re pretty underwhelming. In part, this is the nature of a 1-on-1, outplay champion. But for physical assassins, flat armor penetration is exacerbating the problem. Mages and marksmen—the assassin’s natural prey—don’t typically build defenses early on, so the bulk of their armor in lane comes from levels (Zhonya’s Hourglass is the main exception). So, if assassins start snowballing, flat armor penetration punches through a significant portion of their target’s armor, continuing the snowball. But if assassins fall behind, their threat is mitigated by their targets’ innate stats alone. To give attack damage based assassins more consistency, we’re reworking armor penetration to be more consistently impactful late game without being overbearing early on.
					
					
						Lethality
					
					
						MATH Lethality immediately grants 40% of its value as flat armor penetration. The remaining 60% scales linearly with enemy level.
							
					
						EXAMPLE 10 lethality grants 4 flat armor penetration up front and 0.33 flat armor penetration per enemy level, capping at the full 10 once enemies are level 18.
																	
					
						updatedPrecision (Tier 5 Cunning mastery)
					
					
						About the same amount of flat armor penetration, except now it’s lethality.
					
					
						LETHAL PRECISION! 0.6 (+0.06 per level) flat armor penetration / point ⇒ 1.7 lethality / point
					
					
						FIVE TIMES AS PRECISE At 5 points, grants 3 (+0.3 per level) flat armor penetration ⇒ 8.5 lethality
					
					
						updatedFlat Armor Penetration Runes
					
					
						These now grant lethality instead of flat armor penetration, and they all break even at level 12.

						Serrated Dirk
					
					
						Attack damage up. On-hit damage after kill removed. Out of combat movement speed added.
					
					
						Assassins are best when they have to find the right moment to all-in their opponents. The ability to whittle their opponents down simply isn’t a major class strength for them. In other words, Most assassins want better roaming and better burst out of their items, not better lane harass. So, we’re giving it to them.

						 Like Youmuu’s Ghostblade, Maw of Malmortius is also a grab bag of damage stats; in designer talk, it isn’t really stat bound to class. Unlike Youmuu’s, Maw is warping what it means to be an assassin: assassins are bursty, while Maw supports an extended damage pattern. This wasn’t a problem while Maw of Malmortius was the only available defensive item for both classes, but with Edge of Night taking over as the go-to defensive item for assassins, we feel comfortable moving Maw into fighter territory. We’re cutting the Armor Penetration to make this a less attractive buy for assassins. If they’re opting into Maw for the shield, they will be paying a cost: weaker burst.

				Living Jungle
			
		
			
				
					
						Introduction
					
					
						Introducing plants to the Rift.
					
					
						Pre-season is here and with it are new things to explore in the jungle. We want to make Summoner’s Rift feel more alive and that’s where Plants come into play. Plants create new ways for teams to take control of the map and approach objectives, as well as how you engage in future fights. Different plants spawn in on the map during certain parts of the game in order to provide interesting combat situations and rewarding players who adapt to them. 
						
						Plants have evolved pretty significantly during their time on PBE, and we’ll continue iterating on them throughout pre-season. We’re excited to see how you use them!
					
					
	                    
	                
					
					
						Spawn locations
					
					Red = Blast Cone
						
						Blue = Scryer’s Bloom
						
						Green = Honeyfruit
						
					
						General mechanics
					
					
						FOLIAGE Plants are stationary, neutral units with 1 health. Destroying them (via basic attack) triggers an effect.
					
					
						NURTURE Plants spawn as inactive seeds and take 60 seconds to become usable. Each seed type has a unique appearance.
					
					
						FIRST SPAWN First spawn locations for all plants are pre-determined
					
					
						SPAWN NATURE Each plant has its own set of spawn rules - see below
					
					
						STARTER GARDEN The first wave of plants is identical in every game
					
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Blast Cone
					
					
						FLY AWAY Knocks away nearby units (including the attacker) when destroyed—even over walls
					
					
						AIM THERE Blast Cone displays a self-only indicator to champions in the blast radius, showing where they’ll land if it’s detonated
					
					
						SPAWN POINTS Blast Cones spawn in two spots per jungle quadrant, an inner point toward the center of the quadrant, and an outer point near Baron/Dragon
					
					
						FIRST INNER CONE SPAWN 1:15 - 1:25
					
					
						FIRST OUTER CONE SPAWN 2:15 - 2:30
					
					
						INNER CONE RESPAWN TIME 5 - 7 minutes
					
					
						OUTER CONE RESPAWN TIME 5.5 - 6.5 minutes
										
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Scryer's Bloom
					
					
						SIGHT BEYOND SIGHT When destroyed, releases vision-granting pollen in a large cone that flies in the direction the attacker was facing, revealing units and wards for 12 seconds (3 seconds on champions)
					
					
						AIM THERE Scryer’s Bloom displays a self-only range indicator to champions on mouse-over, showing which direction the pollen will fly
					
					
						SPAWN POINTS Scryer’s Bloom can spawn in two spots per jungle quadrant, close to river ramps
					
					
						FIRST SPAWN 3:00 - 3:30, always at each quadrant’s spawn point nearest to the side lanes
					
					
						NEXT-SPAWN TIME 5 - 6.5 minutes at either spawn point, starting once a given quadrant’s Scryer’s Bloom is destroyed
					
					
						NO TWO BLOOMS Only one Scryer’s Bloom can be present per quadrant
										
				
			
		
		
			
				
					
						Honeyfruit
					
					
						TREE OF MANY FRUITS Drops 5 fruits on the ground when killed
					
					
						I ATE AN ORANGE AND IT WAS K Each fruit heals for 3.5% of max health or 8 (+6 per level) flat health, whichever is higher.
					
					
						FOOD COMA Eating a fruit slows you for 35% for 0.25 seconds
					
					
						SPAWN ZONES Honeyfruit spawn along river walls, starting near Dragon or Baron pits and slowly extending closer toward lanes over the course of the game
					
					
						FIRST SPAWN 5:00 - 5:30 minutes
					
					
						RESPAWN TIME 5.5 - 7 minutes
					
					
						THE FRUIT NEVER FALLS FAR FROM THE TREE If a Honeyfruit isn’t taken before its respawn timer completes, a second Honeyfruit may spawn. No more than two Honeyfruits can exist per half of the river.

					Smite
				
				
					Smite bonuses (the benefits you get from Smiting a camp) are a feature we actually think functions pretty well at giving junglers tools to contest objectives and control the map. However, we think we can do better, so we’re removing Smite bonuses to give us room to make improvements elsewhere. However, there is one important function of Smite bonuses that we haven’t reliably replicated elsewhere: sustain. Smite will continue to carry that burden whenever used on any camp.
				
				
					removedNO MORE WOLF SPIRIT Large monsters no longer grant bonuses when Smited. (Red and blue buffs still exist!)

					Hunter's Machete
				
				
					On-hit damage up. Lifesteal up.
				
				
					With Krug and Gromp Smite bonuses gone, we’re upping both the damage and sustain on Hunter’s Machete (and its upgrades) to compensate.
				
				
					ON-HIT DAMAGE 20 ⇒ 25
				
				
					LIFESTEAL 8% ⇒ 10 %
				
				
					PAY IT FORWARD These changes apply to Hunter’s Machete upgrades as well
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Monster Spawn & Reward Changes
				
				
					Monster respawn times longer. Monster gold and experience rewards up.
				
				
					The gap between fast-clearing and slow-clearing junglers is too high. Clearing is always going to be easier for power farmers and bursty clearers, but we think some aspects of the scaling of the jungle monsters is accentuating those differences out a bit too much.
					
					First, junglers pay too much of an opportunity cost when ganking, thanks to how quickly jungle monsters respawn. Champions with high clear speeds can afford to sneak in a gank or invade while their camps are respawning, while champions with lower clear speeds are far too often just leaving their camps sitting whenever they try to do anything. We want more time in between spawns so that slower clearing junglers aren’t giving up so much if they clear their camps before ganking. To compensate, we’re upping the gold and experience rewards for killing camps.
					
					Second, the way that monsters scale is disproportionately benefitting fast clears. The level of camps is based on the average level of the players in the game, which mean faster clearers end up fighting a weaker overall jungle (because they’re clearing it earlier). This is most notable early game, so we want to create brackets of levels that aren’t as sensitive to small variations in levels. These brackets should correspond approximately to “first buffs and first clear”, “second clear and second buffs”, and “next few clears”, but your mileage may vary depending on game pacing and jungle choices.
				
				
					SMALL CAMP RESPAWN 100 seconds ⇒ 150 seconds
				
				
					MONSTER LEVELING Monster levels now fall into four brackets, dependent on the average character level in game.
					
							Levels 1-3
						
						
							Levels 4-6
						
						
							Levels 7-9
						
						
							Levels 10+: scales linearly.
						
					
				
					REWARDS First clear gives about the same amount of gold/experience. Taking Krugs gives more. Rewards across game time slightly decreased.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Camp Updates
				
				
					We like what camps like Gromp and Raptors have done for making different camps feel distinct to clear. This pre-season, we’re sharpening those distinctions even more.

								Blue Sentinel & Red Brambleback
							
							
								The Red and Blue Buff camps are like mini-bosses, and we wanted to make room for each buff to have unique character. The Sentinels weren’t adding much, and there were already plenty of three-monster camps anyway. Removing the Sentinels and pushing those stats back into the buff monster lets the Sentinel and Brambleback hold onto all of the strength of their camp. To distinguish the two camps from one another, Blue Sentinel is easier for magic damage dealers to take, while Red Brambleback dies more quickly to physical damage.
							
							
								CANNIBALISM Small monsters removed. Blue Sentinel & Red Brambleback stats up slightly to compensate
							
							
								FIND WEAKNESS Blue Sentinel has negative magic resist; Red Brambleback has negative armor. (Magic and physical damage are increased against them, respectively)
														
						
													
							
								Raptors
							
							
								Raptors are the area of effect camp, so we’re adding even more raptors.
							
							
								CHICKEN COOP Two more raptors added.
							
							
								CRIMSON RAPTOR Health cut by roughly half, damage cut by roughly two thirds
							
							
								RAPTORS Health increased by roughly half
																					
						
													
							
								Krugs
							
							
								There’s no camp for the jungler who wants to sacrifice time spent on the map in exchange for more gold. We’re reimagining Krugs as a time sink for players who want to do just that.
							
							
								NESTING KRUGS Krug camp now consists of one Ancient Krug and one Krug. When killed, the Ancient Krug spawns two Krugs (~60% less health). When Krugs are killed, they spawn two mini Krugs (~88% less health)
							
							
								LATE TO THE PARTY Krugs spawn 15 seconds after the other camps
														
						
													
							
								Gromp
							
							
								Gromp is already serving its niche as the single-target camp quite well. However, for slower clearing champions, its persistent threat can serve as too much of a deterrent. We’re adjusting its damage profile so that it does less damage the longer you’re fighting it. If you can burst it, or if you can weather the initial storm, Gromp’s your boy.
							
							
								TONGUE LASH Gromp’s attack damage is now significantly lower, but attack speed is significantly higher. However, his attack speed steadily decreases over time.
							
							
								LATE TO THE PARTY Gromp spawns 15 seconds after the other camps.
														
						
													
							
								Murk Wolves
							
							
								Murk Wolves are the every man camp, so we’re not going to do major changes here.
							
							
								MURKY Murk Wolves are unchanged, other than the overall camp changes above
							
						
					
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Rift Herald
				
				
					Rift Herald spawns later and hits less hard.
				
				
					Rift Herald is supposed to be a threatening objective for split-pushers to contest. Its high damage renders it too threatening to be worth taking, as it often turns into a trap for players who try to start it, especially early on. We’re pushing Rift Herald’s spawn back to a time more appropriate to such a strong objective, and dialing back on its damage so that players have clearer opportunities to secure it.
				
				
					SPAWN TIME 6 minutes ⇒ 10 minutes
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 105 ⇒ 85
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Elder Dragon
				
				
					Elder Dragon is no longer more difficult for each drake you’ve taken. Aspect of the Dragon duration up.
				
				
					 Elder Dragon is supposed to be an epic late game objective that helps secure a win. The teams who should feel best about taking Elder Dragon are the ones who have already secured a few dragons. However, the more dragons you’ve already taken, the harder it is to take down. When Elder Dragon takes that long to kill, starting it can feel like a mistake, because it opens up baron to the other team. This is only compounded by the fact that Elder Dragon buff lasts half as long as Baron buff.
				
				
					removedANGER MANAGEMENT Elder Dragon no longer deals more damage and takes less damage based on how many elemental drakes your team has secured
				
				
					ASPECT OF THE DRAGON 120 seconds ⇒ 150 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Minions
				
				
					As the game scales past laning phase, some classes opt out of engaging with minions (hi, tanks and supports) while most others just steamroll through waves early on. We’re strengthening the differences between minion types in order to get a better picture of which champions are engaging with them and why they are doing so, creating more opportunities for other champions to interact with them as the game progresses.
				
				
					Melee Minions
				
				
					LIFE CHANGING Health growth over time increased by ~60%
				
				
					LESS DAMAGE Melee minions no longer gain attack damage as the game progresses
				
				
					Ranged Minions
				
				
					LIFE CHANGING Health growth over time decreased by ~60%
				
				
					MORE DAMAGE Ranged minions now gain ~100% attack damage as the game progresses
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Turrets
				
				
					Two years ago we made Inhibitors and Nexus turrets shoot laser beams instead of laser bullets. We're reverting that change from back then in order to streamline the way turrets attack across the board.
				
				
					new? LASER STUFF Inhibitor and Nexus turrets melt enemies with lasers ⇒ fire laser bullets like all other turrets
				
				
					We’re standardizing the damage turrets deal to minions to ensure last hitting under turret isn’t changed with the minion health changes above. (Last-hit after one turret shot for casters, two for melees—in case you didn’t know.)
				
				
					DAMAGE TO MINIONS Turret bullets now deal a fixed percent of minion max health:
				
				
						
							MELEE ~45% health per bullet
						
					
					
						
							RANGED ~70% health per bullet
												
					
					
						
							SIEGE ~14% health per bullet
												
					
					
						
							SUPER ~5% health per bullet
												
					
				
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Minimap Icons
				
				
					Reducing minimap clutter and improving icon readability on important objectives.
				
				
					JUNGLE CAMPS Krugs, Raptors, Murkwolves, Gromp and Scuttlecrab now have smaller icons (Red Brambleback and Blue Sentinel icons unchanged)
				
				
					TURRETS Turret minimap icons now change at 66% and 33% remaining health

			Aegis of the Legion Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Aegis of the Legion
				
				
					Aura removed. Health removed. MR increased. Armor added.
				
				
					There’s just no way around it: Aegis of the Legion is too strong. No amount of magic resist would feel impactful on one champion without being overpowered on five, so we’re removing the aura. With that out of the way, we need to give supports other ways to accomplish what Aegis of the Legion did: protect their team. To do that, we’re introducing a few new items and bolstering a few old friends. More on that in a bit.
					
					But what does Aegis look like without its aura? The Aegis line is for low-level champions who are at risk of deletion, yet are expected to roam and ward alone (supports and utility junglers, that’s you). With assassins running around, Aegis is the perfect buy to feel a bit safer straying into the Fog of War.

					Locket of the Iron Solari
				
				
					Aura and health removed. Shield and magic resist increased. Now has armor.
				
				
					With the Aegis aura gone, we want to make sure Locket still feels impactful in fights, so we’re doubling the shield. It also brings more magic resist than you can shake a stick at, so don’t worry about getting bursted before you can drop the bass. And by the bass we mean shield.

				updated
				
					Banner of Command
				
				
					Redesigned. Now a tank item.
				
				
					Unlike Locket, Banner’s being rebuilt from the ground up. Banner of Command previously built out of a tank item (Aegis of the Legion) and a mage item (Fiendish Codex). This felt fine for enchanters when Aegis was a must-buy, but made Banner inaccessible to tanks. With the number of caster support items already available, we felt it more appropriate to give tanks more options to build out of Aegis, rather than splitting the item’s functions between several classes (tanks and enchanters and the occasional burst mage).

					Chalice of Harmony now duplicates bonus mana regen as bonus health regen.
				
				
					Chalice’s old passive was confusing. Is extra mana regen really worth it if you spend it all healing back to full? For all that complexity, it wasn’t having enough of an impact on the game, so we’re updating it to be clearer. Healers who invest in mana regen now get to spend less of that mana topping their health bars off.

					Redemption
				
				
					Redemption gives one more spell -- bringing both a heal and damage -- available even after death.
				
				
					Are you an enchanter? Do you love healing and shielding your teammates so they don’t die? Do you hate dying, not because you’re dead, but because you know your carry doesn’t stand a chance without you? No problem! Redemption not only boosts your healing, but also gives you an additional ability that can even be used while dead. With Redemption, you can give your carry a second chance at life, even if yours is already over.

Can be used while dead. (Half effect if the target has been affected by another Redemption recently)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Ardent Censer
				
				
					Grants less on-hit damage, but now grants an on-hit heal.
				
				
					Ardent Censer embodies a simple concept—keep your carries alive and make them hit harder—but the on-hit buff was only doing one of those things. By shifting some of the damage to sustain, we’re giving supports the ability to enhance trades and duels by keeping their carries alive, not just giving them more damage.

					Mikael's Crucible
				
				
					No longer heals, but has no travel time and grants your target slow immunity. Successful cleanses also grant them movement speed.
				
				
					Using Mikael’s Crucible correctly can be pretty difficult, and often goes unnoticed. We want to make sure Mikael’s Crucible fills the niche of crowd control removal in a more satisfying way. We’re removing the existing travel time to make it more consistent and making sure it’s clear when Mikael’s has been used successfully. That means trimming power from Mikael’s elsewhere, so we’re removing the heal from the active.

					Wardens have a lot of tools to control teamfights, throwing crowd control left and right. But when it comes to protecting a single target from damage, they often find themselves unable to help out (unless their name is Braum).

					Alistar
				
				
					Gameplay update for Alistar. Passive and E are conceptually swapping places.
				
				
					Alistar’s been on our radar since our “support supports” work earlier in the season. He’s got powerful initiation and one of the best damage mitigation tools in the game, but also reliable healing opponents can’t really do anything about. It’s unclear how to win in lane against a tank that heals his team: poke damage doesn’t stick, burst damage isn’t enough to bring him down, and you can’t get past him to kill his carry instead. This means we’ve had to water down a lot of Alistar’s tools to keep him fair.
					
					As a result, Alistar’s teamfight gameplay is marked by a lot of downtime. After initiating with W+Q, he doesn’t have much to do beyond pressing R and trying to block skillshots. Damage soaking is an important contribution, but as League’s mad cow, we think Alistar should do more to aggressively disrupt the enemy team once he dives into the fray. He’s losing some reliability in exchange (particularly in terms of his healing), but a greater risk of failure lets us give him greater rewards for success.
				
				
					newPassive - Triumphant Roar
				
				
					STACKS Alistar gains Triumph stacks when applying hard crowd control to enemy champions and when nearby units die, healing himself and the closest ally when he reaches 7 stacks

	                With the pre-season’s changes to stealth, it was only natural that we involved Twitch. Well-known for his powerful ambushing and late-game scaling, Twitch’s stealth is a uniquely aggressive trait among marksmen who typically favor range and safety. Where Twitch’s pattern breaks down is when he’s able to amass so much damage that popping out by enemies isn’t an actual drawback (since they’ll be dead anyways). Changing Twitch to use camouflage means the dirty rat gets to retain his razor-edge stealth plays, but also gives opponents a chance to catch him before he retreats into the shadows.

					Ivern
				
				
					Q cooldown decreased. Daisy has more health and is generally smarter.
				
				
					Ivern’s still new to the Rift, taking his time to get acquainted with the local wildlife (and winning, for that matter). Experienced Iverns are getting a lot of mileage out of the Greenfather, but his first couple of games are posing too steep a challenge. We’re touching up Ivern’s experience by tackling some of his less-smooth interactions (specifically with Rootcaller and Daisy!), while tossing in some power-positive changes for good measure.
				
				
					Q - Rootcaller
				
				
					COOLDOWN 16/15/14/13/12 seconds ⇒ 14/13/12/11/10 seconds
				
				
					newTREE SIN Ivern can now reactivate Rootcaller to take the dash portion of the ability in addition to issuing a basic attack
				
				
				
					R - Daisy!
				
				
					HEALTH  1250/2000/3500 ⇒ 1250/2500/3750
				
				
					PUSHING DAISY Daisy should generally be smarter when it comes to following Ivern’s commands
				
			
		
	
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Kled
				
				
					Remounts more quickly. W damage down.
				
				
					Kled is a bloodthirsty little yordle who loves violence. He’s not having any issue starting fights, thanks to Chaaaaaaaarge!!! Once he’s in the thick of things, Kled brings both high damage and the ability to turn a fight around with a timely remount, and we think that’s left him at a pretty good power level. However, we think remounting is what makes Kled’s combat pattern unique, and we’d like it to be more consistently accessible. Kled is at a pretty good power right now, which means his sustained damage needs to dip to compensate.
				
				
					Passive - Skaarl, the Cowardly Lizard
				
				
					REMOUNT TIME 1 second ⇒ .5 seconds
				
				
					W - Violent Tendencies
				
				
					4TH HIT DAMAGE 4/5/6/7/8% of target’s maximum health ⇒ 4/4.5/5/5.5/6% of target’s maximum health

			Items
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Abyssal Scepter
				
				
					Flat magic resist reduction replaced with magic damage amplification.
				
				
					Abyssal Scepter is a must-rush item. When purchased before the opposing team can build magic resist, it provides (sigh) tons of damage. But once the other team builds into defenses, Scepter starts to fall off. This gave it a natural rivalry with Aegis of the Legion’s teamwide aura. Now that Aegis no longer beefs up carry resistances, Abyssal Scepter would run unchecked early and take too long to fall off. We’re pushing it away from that early power spike and making it feel useful at all stages of the game.
				
				
					removedMAGIC RESIST REDUCTION No longer provides UNIQUE Aura: Reduces the magic resist of nearby enemies by 20
				
				
					newMAGIC DAMAGE AMPLIFICATION UNIQUE Aura: Nearby enemy champions take 10% more magic damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Hextech Revolver
				
				
					On-hit damage reduced.
				
				
					For an early-game purchase, the damage on Revolver is too damn high.
				
				
					DAMAGE UNIQUE Passive - Magic Bolt: Damage reduced from 75 - 150 ⇒ 50 - 125
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Hextech Protobelt-01
				
				
					Damage from multiple bolts down. AP scaling down.
				
				
					Protobelt should give champions like Kennen the added mobility and initiation power they need to get in the face of their enemies. However, the damage its active deals is currently so high that it’s overshadowing that utility.
				
				
					DAMAGE PER ADDITIONAL BOLT 30% ⇒ 20%
				
				
					RATIO 0.35 ability power ⇒ 0.25 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		Back to top
	
	
			Masteries
		
	
		
			
				
					Last pre-season saw a ground-up rebuild of masteries with the goal of making mastery choices more about individual playstyle than numerical buffs. Though we’ve had a few balance challenges over the season, the basic premise has held up over time. We’re filling in the remaining holes in each tree with an eye toward further sharpening this ‘playstyle-first’ vision, and addressing two of the ‘problem children’ remaining in the system.
					
					Side-note: we recently shipped an article sharing most of the information in this section, so if you get deja-vu, you’re not crazy (or psychic).
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Ferocity
				
				
					The Ferocity tree caters to champions who prefer lengthier fights over bursting opponents down. We’re adding a few new ways for these types to customize how their fights play out.
				
				
					
						Tier 2
					
							Double Edged Sword
						
						
							In general, lower mastery tiers are impactful early, but fall off later. This keeps decision making reasonable. As a scaling mastery, Double Edged Sword isn’t a great fit for Tier 2, so we’re moving it higher.
						
						
							UP WE GO Moved to Tier 4
						
						
							newFresh Blood
						
						
							Impactful early, falls off late. Yeah.
						
						
							OUCH Your first basic attack against a champion deals an additional 10 (+1 per level) damage (9 second cooldown)
											
					
						Tier 4
					
							Tier 4 offers three different flavors of damage scaling, making it a better fit for Double Edged Sword.
						
						
							Double Edged Sword
						
						
							Risk-reward incarnate. Remember: (most) dead people deal no damage.
						
						
							INCREASED DAMAGE DEALT 3% ⇒ 5%
						
						
							INCREASED DAMAGE TAKEN 1.5% ⇒ 2.5%
						
						
							Bounty Hunter
						
						
							Provides the highest bonus if you can manage to stack it.
						
						
							DAMAGE PER UNIQUE KILL 1% ⇒ 1.5%
						
						
							MAXIMUM BONUS 5% ⇒ 7.5%
						
						
							newBattle Trance
						
						
							Safe and guaranteed, but takes time to ramp up.
						
						
							BLINDED BY RAGE Gain up to 5% increased damage over 5 seconds when in combat with enemy champions
						
						
							removedOppressor
						
						
							Champions either have perma-crowd control or they don’t. How you play makes little difference when the only question is whether you can activate Oppressor or not, so we’re removing it in favor of more versatile options. See above.
						
						
							NOT SO OPPRESSIVE Removed
						
					
						Keystone Tier
					
							Fervor of Battle has been an on-again, off-again balance challenge for us throughout 2016, mostly due to on-hit effects only working when attack speed and basic attacking are prioritized above all else. Many Fervor users might prefer to focus on crit chance for harder-hitting attacks or cooldown reduction for more spellcasting, but can’t because neither approach optimizes on-hit damage. In other words, Fervor doesn’t just support the attack speed playstyle, it suppresses everything else in the ‘sustained physical damage’ space.
							We’re switching Fervor’s bonus to raw attack damage, a stat that fits in multiple approaches toward extended fighting. If we’re being direct, this is a power-down for on-hit builds, but ‘power-down’ doesn’t mean ‘unusable’. We want to put all flavors of Fervor users back on an even playing field, not kick the old ones out.
						
						
							updatedFervor of Battle
						
						
							STACKING Hitting champions with basic attacks and abilities generates a Fervor stack (2 for melee attacks, 2 second cooldown for abilities). This is unchanged.
						
						
							MAXIMUM STACKS 8 ⇒ 10
						
						
							STACK DURATION 6 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
						
						
							newATTACK DAMAGE Stacks now grant 1-6 attack damage
						
						
							removedON-HIT DAMAGE Basic attacks no longer deals 1-14 bonus physical damage per stack against champions
						
					
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Cunning
				
				
					Cunning’s in a reasonably stable place, offering choices for champs who favor burst or utility—in some cases both, such as Stormraider’s Surge. We’re filling the last gap in the tree.
				
				
					
						Tier 4
					
							newGreenfather's Gift
						
						
							Extra oomph for champions who duck in and out of brush between combat.
						
						
							BLOOM! Stepping into brush causes your next damaging attack or ability to deal 3% of your target's current health as bonus magic damage (9s Cooldown)
						
					
						Tier 5
					
							Precision
						
						
							We chatted about this earlier. Go read the lethality stuff.
						
						
							newLETHALITY 1.7 lethality per point (8.5 lethality at 5 points)
						
						
							removedFLAT ARMOR PENETRATION No longer grants 0.6 (+0.06 per level) flat armor penetration per point (3 (+0.3 per level) flat armor penetration at 5 points)
						
					
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
					Resolve
				
				
					The Resolve tree provides some solid options to make champions tankier, but ironically falls a bit flat in supporting the tank playstyle. We’re adding choices that reward tanks for actively doing their job rather than just making them passively beefier.
				
				
					
						Tier 2
					
							newSiegemaster
						
						
							Siegemaster helps you survive poke and live through dive attempts while sitting under tower.
						
						
							EVEN MORE PROTECTED Gain 8 armor and magic resist when near an allied turret
						
					
						Tier 4
					
							newFearless
						
						
							Extra mitigation at the start of a fight.
						
						
							BY A SPLIT Gain 10% bonus armor and magic resist (+2 flat armor and magic resist per level) when damaged by an enemy champion for 2 seconds (9 second cooldown)
						
					
						Keystone Tier
					
							removedStrength of the Ages
						
						
							Strength of the Ages is the only keystone that’s become almost mandatory for an entire position, regardless of playstyle: the jungle. Health is useful for every class, so it stands to reason that champs who wouldn’t otherwise take Strength would still pick it in the jungle, where it stacks fastest. The problem: most junglers now end up with 300 extra health, plus other survivability bonuses from the Resolve tree. This works for tanks, but when damage threats find success with defensive setups, opponents have no means of fighting back. We’re retiring Strength of the Ages so junglers gravitate toward keystones that enhance playstyle, not their position—ensuring that damage dealers play like damage dealers, and tanks play like tanks.Note: We know that Strength of the Ages was a genuine fit for some junglers. Removing it will be a hit to these core users, but with other pre-season changes in the mix, we don’t think anyone will be left without a keystone for their playstyle. Once the dust has settled, we’ll see if anyone’s fallen far enough to warrant follow-up.
						
						
							LOST TO THE AGES Removed
						
						
							newCourage of the Colossus
						
						
							Giving initiators a survivability tool in the moment they need it most: diving into the enemy team.
						
						
							ARGUS Gain a shield for 7% (+7% for each additional nearby enemy champion) of your maximum health for 4 seconds after hitting an enemy champion with hard crowd control (30 second cooldown)
						
						
							GO HARD Stun, root, suppression, taunt, charm, fear, terrify, knockup, and knockback count as hard crowd control

	        League Client Update
	    
	
	    
	        
	            
	                The changelog now lives in the patch notes. Open beta is coming for all regions during this patch!
	            
	            
	                Once the beta begins, the download will appear for everyone launching the game, and if you don't feel like upgrading right away, you'll still have the option to upgrade through your launcher at any point during the beta. For testing purposes, open beta will hit OCE slightly earlier during patch 6.22 than other regions. 
	                We’ll be working out a few kinks and adding the remainder of the client’s missing features (like spectator mode) over the next few patches—it’s a beta, after all! To those of you who want to jump in right away: if you run into anything funky, be sure to hit us with that sweet, sweet feedback. 
	                Check out the open beta FAQ for more details.
	            
	            
	                New features
	            
	            
	                Below are the major updates for the League client update this patch. Bear in mind that this is not a complete list of everything that was added or changed. 
	            
	            
	                NEWREPLAYS We're testing replays on NA and OCE during patch 6.22. Replays will be available only on the updated client. If you’re in the League client update alpha, please give replays a test-run before we release it worldwide.
	            
	            
	                CUSTOM GAMES Custom games are now available in the updated client, however you cannot yet view the list of all public custom games. That will come in a future patch. (Known issue: custom game spectators will remain stuck in champion select if the spectator option is set to \"Lobby only.\")
	            
	            
	                TREELINE CO-OP Co-op vs AI is now available for Twisted Treeline. (Known issue: there’s no options for difficulty—it defaults to beginner.)
	            
	            
	                BATTLE TRAINING  Battle Training is now available
	            
	            
	                ACCOUNT CHANGES Summoner name changes and account transfers now work in the updated client
	            
	            
	                
	            
	                Finally, as a small thank you for the hard work of alpha testers, we created an exclusive summoner icon for everyone who participated in the alpha. Your feedback was invaluable for the client team. If you log in to the alpha before November 15th, you'll get it!

			Bugfixes
		
	
		
			
				
					We always fix more bugs than we list in the patch notes, but that's especially true this time around. Fun fact: this set of notes is 14 thousand words long.
				
				Gangplank's Q - Parrley! crits no longer travel faster than normal casts, fixing a bug that prevented him from chaining extra barrels during the travel time.
					
					Lucian's W - Ardent Blaze no longer auto-fires in the same direction as Passive - Lightslinger's second shot if cast between Lightslinger's shots
					
					Fixed a bug that allowed Thresh to cast W - Dark Passage globally under specific circumstances. No lantern was created, but Thresh gained vision of the target area.
					
					Illaoi's tentacles now normally swing at champions under the effects of Taric's R - Cosmic Radiance or Kindred's R - Lamb's Respite
					
					Jinx can no longer queue up Q - Switcheroo! during the cast time of R - Super Mega Death Rocket! This addresses a bug that sometimes caused the rocket to appear further ahead to enemies than it was.
					Master Yi's Q - Alpha Strike now properly charges Statikk Shiv's passive
					
					PROJECT: Fiora's Passive - Duelist's Dance Vitals indicators no longer visually disappear before the effect expires
					
					PROJECT: Yasuo's basic attack animations have been adjusted to visually slash the target at the same time damage is applied, rather than slightly after
					
					Blackfrost Anivia's W - Crystallize visuals have been widened to match her other skins (actual hitbox was never broken!)
					
					When cast on a turret, Star Guardian Janna's E - Eye of the Storm visuals now properly disappear if the shield is broken
					
					Ivern can no longer be flagged as AFK if he farms the jungle for too long without interacting with anyone else
					
					Wooglet's Witchcap's tooltip now properly indicates its active has a 120-second cooldown
					
					Lowered the volume of Creator Viktor's R - Chaos Storm churning
					
					Lulu's running animation has been restored on all skins
					
					Winter Wonder Lulu'x Pix attack VFX have been re-snow-ified
					
					Cassiopeia now properly plays VO lines when placing wards
					
					Star Guardian Jinx's corpse no longer gets stuck in a \"T-pose\" if she dies while casting Q - Switcheroo!
					
					Brolaf no longer plays two VO lines at once when activating R - Ragnarok
					
					Snow Day Gnar's E - Hop bouncing audio has been fixed when Gnar stomps on friendly targets

		Greetings, Summoners.
		Pre-season’s nearly upon us, so this patch’s focus is keeping things stable for another few weeks until features like the Assassin update make their way to your QWER keys.
		It’s a pretty small patch overall, though there are a few things we’re continuing to follow up on. Some of these are relatively fresh faces (such as Koggy and Nunu) while others are names we haven’t seen for a hot minute (Nidalee, Graves). We won’t drag this intro out just for the sake of word count, so get to reading the notes below!
		As a reminder, the top of the Champions list is reserved for the featured change of the patch. Incidentally, this is the first time that champion’s name hasn’t started with ‘A’ so now you know it’s for real.
		Good luck, have fun, and see you in pre-season!

		Mid-Patch Updates
	

	
		
			
				10/26/2016
			
			
			
				Teleport
			
			
				HELLO SHOPKEEPER Fixed a bug that caused Teleport to rarely drop you in the blue side fountain
			
			
			
				Doom Bots of Doom
			
			
				Just to be super-duper clear, these fixes only apply to the Doom Bots of Doom featured game mode!
			
			
				TEARS Tear of the Goddess and Manamune now properly grant 6 maximum mana per spellcast instead of 4 (12 for Archangel's Staff)
			
			
				BIGGER TEARS Manamune and Archangel's Staff now properly upgrade to Muramana and Seraph's Embrace once fully stacked
			
		



	

		
			
				10/20/2016
			
			
			
				Ryze
			
			
				OVERLY OVERLOADED Fixed a bug where, when Q - Overload hit a target marked with Flux, it bounced to all nearby targets even if they weren't also marked with Flux
			
		
	



	
			Champions
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Nidalee
				
				
					Cougar cooldowns up. Primal Surge heal now heals less at higher health.
				
				
					Nidalee is no stranger to patch notes, but we’re revisiting her this patch to look at the frustration enemies face when they try to punish Nidalee’s mistakes. In the jungle, punishment is less about trades, and more about tradeoffs. Camp clearing takes time away from map pressure, map pressure takes time away from clearing, and getting chunked to low health makes it unsafe for you to do either.
					Nidalee is too good at avoiding that punishment right now. Her high mobility and clear speed minimize the map pressure sacrifices she makes to farm, while her constant sustain keeps her topped off the whole time. Even if you catch her while her abilities on cooldown, those cooldowns are so low that she’s got a good chance of winning the fight anyway.
					Basically, Nidalee just doesn’t leave a lot of openings for enemy champions to fight. Normal opportunities—abilities on cooldown or missing some health—don’t apply consistently enough to her. We want Nidalee’s opponents to feel like there are correct times to pick fights with her, rather than letting her fully dictate the tempo of engagement.
				
				
					Cougar Q - Takedown
				
				
					COOLDOWN 5 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 6 seconds at all ranks
				
				
					Cougar W - Pounce
				
				
					COOLDOWN 5 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 6 seconds at all ranks
				
				
					Cougar E - Swipe
								
				
					COOLDOWN 5 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 6 seconds at all ranks
				
				
					Human E - Primal Surge
				
				
					HEALING 45/85/125/165/205 ⇒ 25-50/45-90/65-130/85-170/105-210 (based on missing health)
				
				
					RATIO 0.5 ability power ⇒ 0.275 - 0.55 ability power (based on missing health)
				
			
		
	

	
		
			
			
				Ashe
			
			
				Q mana cost bugfix.
			
			
				This one’s for the button-spammers of the world.
			
			
				Q - Ranger's Focus
			
			
				BUGFIX Fixed a bug where rapidly pressing Q the instant Focus reaches four stacks could cause Ranger’s Focus’s mana cost to apply multiple times
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Graves
			
			
				Quickdraw now gives fewer resists when not dashing in.
			
			
				Graves is the marksman for players who want to get right up in the enemy’s face. True Grit gives Graves enough durability to take a few hits when going toe-to-toe with opponents, but it’s also making him too tanky when he’s kiting away from a fight. Graves’s defenses are meant to enable aggressive Quick Draws, so we’re weakening the reward when he isn’t dashing in.
			
			
				E - Quickdraw
			
			
				TRUE GRIT CAP 4 stacks ⇒ 8 stacks
			
			
				LET’S SEE YOU GRIT THOSE TEETH Now gains 2 stacks of True Grit upon dashing towards an enemy champion
			
			
				RESISTS PER STACK 10/15/20/25/30 armor and magic resist ⇒ 5/7.5/10/12.5/15 armor and magic resist (max resists unchanged)
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Ivern
			
			
				Resurfacing 6.20’s mid-patch updates.
			
			
				Edit: We have some more changes for Ivern's Passive, E, and R. Whoops!
				The base stat changes went out last patch. Just making sure you’ve seen ‘em.
			
			
				General
			
			
				HEALTH GROWTH STAT 74 ⇒ 90
			
			
				BASE MAGIC RESIST 30 ⇒ 32
			
			
				BASE ATTACK SPEED .625 ⇒ .644
			
			
				ATTACK SPEED GROWTH STAT 2.8 ⇒ 3.4
			
			
				Passive - Friend of the Forest
			
			
				STARTING GROVE HEALTH COST 30% max health ⇒ 25% max health
			
			
				E - Triggerseed
			
			
				EXPLOSION RANGE INDICATOR Triggerseed's range indicator now only displays to Ivern's target
			
			
				R - Daisy!
			
			
				LOOK DOWN, DAISY If no enemy champions are nearby, Daisy now targets enemy minions when her current target dies rather than returning to Ivern
			
			
				BE AGGRESSIVE, DAISY Daisy no longer fails to attack enemy champions if they can't see her
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Kog'Maw
			
			
				Mana cost per R cast down, damage up.
			
			
				Back during the Marksman Update, we shifted Living Artillery to be more about executing enemies as they back off, rather than a primary damage tool in its own right. Now that Kog’Maw’s back to his old kiting/spellweaving ways, he’s frequently casting his ult (and stacking its mana cost) while foes are well above the execution thresholds. This leaves Living Artillery feeling pretty lackluster. So, we’re re-tuning it to fit better into Kog’s new (old?) playstyle while holding on to some of the spicy execution feeling we gained from the Marksman Update.
			
			
				R - Living Artillery
			
			
				COST 50 mana + 50 per cast (500 mana maximum) ⇒ 40 mana + 40 per cast (400 mana maximum)

				Lee Sin
			
			
				Back in 6.19 we fixed a bug causing Lee Sin to dash directly on top of his targets, rather than next to them. The fix ended up creating worse issues - namely, Lee’s been getting dropped on the wrong side of walls. So, we’re reverting the 6.19 change.
			
			
				ON TOP OF IT Resonating Strike and Safeguard once again drop Lee Sin directly on top of his target
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Master Yi
			
			
				Bugfixes on Passive, Q and E.
			
			
				Like Zed, Azir, and others before him, we dug into Master Yi’s code to fix a bunch of bugs and came out the other end with a new plan: rewrite the busted stuff. This patch, we’ve got a ground-up recoding of Alpha Strike to help ensure that you only die in Alpha when you deserve it.
			
			
				Passive - Double Strike
			
			
				CRITICAL FAIL Fixed a bug where Master Yi would not critically strike monsters after Double Striking them at certain attack speeds
			
			
				Q - Alpha Strike
			
			
				I WAS IN ALPHA Dying during Alpha Strike will properly play Master Yi’s death animation, placing him where Alpha Strike was portraying him to be
			
			
				newMINIMUM UNTARGETABILITY 0.25 seconds (reminder: untargetable does not mean invulnerable!)
			
			
				BETA STRIKE Fixed a bug where Alpha Strike could sometimes fail to cast but still go on cooldown, and be unable to be reset by basic attacking until Master Yi cast Alpha Strike again
			
			
				newI CAN SEE IT NOW Alpha Strike now also gains vision of where Master Yi will strike on his next bounce
			
			
				WHY WUJU DO THAT Alpha Strike won’t place Master Yi on top of Baron Nashor if Baron is the primary target
			
			
				CHILL, I GOT THIS Meditate is no longer momentarily locked out after a failed Alpha Strike cast
			
			
				I SWEAR I GOT IT Master Yi now becomes eligible for assists as soon as Alpha Strike visually bounces to a target (even though damage is only applied at the end of the animation)
			
			
				E - Wuju Style
			
			
				WUJU FIX THIS BUG Fixed a bug where Wuju Style’s passive attack damage bonus wasn’t counting toward the 25% bonus attack damage scaling of its active effect if Wuju Style was cast immediately as its cooldown expired
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Nasus
			
			
				R now grants armor and magic resist, rather than giving Nasus AD when it damages enemies.
			
			
				Nasus is a quintessential juggernaut: a force of inevitability, a raid boss for the enemy team. There’s no question that he brings enough late-game damage to the table with super-stacked Siphoning Strikes, but damage doesn’t mean anything if Nasus dies before he can reach his opponents. So, rather than yet another source of damage, we’re retooling Fury of the Sands to give Nasus the ability to survive long enough to get into the thick of the fight.
			
			
				Q - Siphoning Strike
			
			
				THE CANE Bonus attack range now stacks with R - Fury of the Sands attack range increase. (Range is now 175 ⇒ 200.)
			
			
				R - Fury of the Sands
			
			
				removedSAND SWORD No longer converts damage dealt by Fury of the Sands into attack damage
			
			
				newSAND SHIELD Now grants 15/35/55 armor and magic resist on activation, gaining an additional 1/2/3 armor and magic resist every second (total of 30/65/100 resistances at 15 seconds)
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Nocturne
			
			
				It was pretty hard to see Shroud of Darkness on a few of Nocturne’s skins. We’re switching them to use his base skin's VFX to keep things clear.
			
			
				W - Shroud of Darkness
			
			
				SHADOW CLARITY Void Nocturne and Frozen Nocturne now use the base skin’s particle for their spell shields
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Nunu
			
			
				Consume health buff reduced.
			
			
				We gave Nunu’s Consume some updates in 6.20, and it looks like we overshot. The new amount of bonus health Q stacks grant, when combined with a properly-functioning Cinderhulk multiplier (hooray bugfixes), has simply made Nunu too tanky, too easily. We’re toning down his health stacking so that opponents feel like they can kill Nunu every once in awhile.
			
			
				Q - Consume
			
			
				BONUS HEALTH PER STACK 3% ⇒ 2%
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Zac
			
			
				E now displays a warning indicator 0.75 seconds before Zac lands.
			
			
				Zac’s shown back up on our radar thanks to Elastic Slingshot’s unique gank opportunities. But when the counterplay to an ability is “dodge it”, it’s important that players have access to consistent information about where it’s headed. Elastic Slingshot isn’t hitting that clarity bar right now, so we’re making it more clear where you should (and shouldn’t) stand if you don’t want to get slime-smushed.
			
			
				General
			
			
				MATTERS MORE THAN YOU THINK Recommended items updated
			
			
				E - Elastic Slingshot
			
			
				CLARITY Warning indicator and shadow particles now show up 0.75 seconds before Zac lands. If his travel duration is shorter than that, they appear immediately.
			
			
				ALSO CLARITY Cast range updated to be more accurate for Zac
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Yorick
			
			
				The Maiden now moves down the lane she was summoned in, even if no enemy minions are nearby.
			
			
				Yorick has the tools to split-push, but sometimes the Maiden of the Mist didn’t seem to understand that. Right now, if no minions are around when she's summoned, she’ll continue to follow Yorick around. Yorick should be able to send the Maiden split-pushing without having to walk all the way down to the minion wave, so we’re helping her find her a way more easily.
			
			
				R - Eulogy of the Isles
			
			
				EASILY DISTRACTED If Yorick summons the Maiden inside of a lane, she’ll start pushing that lane
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				Ziggs
			
			
				E mines check for collision more frequently.
			
			
				If you dashed through Ziggs Minefield, sometimes you wouldn't get hit. This wasn’t a super-common occurrence, but it felt weird when it happened. So, we’re making Hexplosive Minefield do what you’d expect.
			
			
				E - Hexplosive Minefield
			
			
				DETONATE TIMER checks every 0.25 seconds ⇒ checks every 0.1 seconds

		Greetings, Summoners.
		Welcome to 6.20! For our twentieth patch this season, we got you a tree. The Green Father is around so make sure to see the forest for the trees, enjoy the brush all around the map, and don’t forget to hug Daisy!
		Actually, scrap that last one.
		Today, we’re revisiting some champions you probably won’t be surprised to see in the patch notes: Ashe, Vladimir, and Taliyah. They’ve had a rough couple of patches, so we’re looking to make some changes that make it easier to balance them in the future. Add in a few balance tweaks and a new champion, and we’re one patch closer to the pre-season.
		On a clerical note, we’re continuing to use the top of the Champions list to ‘feature’ large or more contentious changes. Ashe starts with A, so she’d have been there anyway... Coincidence? We’ll let you decide.
		Good luck, have fun.

				Ivern Balance Update
			
			
				The Green Father hasn't been out for long, but it's clear that would-be Ivern mains are having a tough time finding success on the Rift. We're targeting two specific issues for now: letting him take better advantage of Brushmaker's basic attack buff, and helping him scale better into the late-game. (The magic resist line is more of a 'buff fix' to make Ivern's stats consistent with most other champs.)
			
			
				General
			
			
				HEALTH GROWTH STAT 74 ⇒ 90
			
			
				MAGIC RESIST 30 ⇒ 32.1
			
			
				ATTACK SPEED 0.625 ⇒ 0.644

					Ashe
				
				
					Passive crit slow is stronger but decays to normal faster. Q no longer fully resets Ashe’s attack timer.
				
				
					With the last few tweaks to Ashe, we’ve delved pretty deep into the idea of what she should and shouldn’t be doing. Ashe should win fights by keeping opponents in the sweet spot between the range of her basic attacks and Volley, but not close enough to retaliate. When she can win stat-checks against opponents who get in range to fight back, much of that gameplay falls away.
					Currently, Ashe’s opponents have few real options to deal with her. They can run (and be slowed until they die) or they can fight (and lose to her high dps). We’re upping Ashe's ability to keep opponents at a distance, but decreasing her damage so opponents have a little more time to close the gap and a fairer chance of winning the fight when they do.
				
				
					Passive - Frost Shot
				
				
					BASE SLOW 5-25% (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 10-20% (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					SLOW ON CRITICAL HIT Double the base slow ⇒ Triple the base slow
				
				
					CRITICAL SLOW DECAY Critical slows decay to the normal slow value over the full slow duration ⇒ the first half of the slow duration
				
				
					Q - Ranger's Focus
				
				
					newMINIMUM ATTACK DELAY Instead of fully resetting Ashe’s basic attack, casting Ranger’s Focus reduces her basic attack delay to 40% of the full value (no reduction if the delay is already below 40%).
				
				
					FOR EXAMPLE If Ashe’s delay between basic attacks is 1 second, casting Ranger’s Focus brings that delay down to 0.40 seconds for the next attack
				
				
					FLURRY DAMAGE 1.15/1.2/1.25/1.3/1.35 total attack damage ⇒ 1.05/1.1/1.15/1.2/1.25 total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Cho'Gath
				
				
					W modernization.
				
				
					We’ve been on a slow crusade to fix League’s cone spells, and this patch we arrive at Cho’Gath. Up until now, Cho’Gath’s Feral Scream decided who to hit based on when W was pressed - not when Feral Scream actually fired. Fixing this bug means opponents can now Flash, dash, or blink away from Feral Scream, which is a pretty sizable hit to its reliability. Our goal isn’t to make Cho’Gath weaker, so we’re giving him more opportunities to yell at people, plus a little more range to offset the “walking away in a straight line” case. That said, more screams = more silence, so we’re giving Cho’s enemies their speaking rights back a bit sooner.
				
				
					W - Feral Scream
				
				
					COOLDOWN 13 seconds ⇒ 13/12/11/10/9 seconds
				
				
					RANGE 585 ⇒ 650
				
				
					SILENCE DURATION 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds ⇒ 1.5/1.625/1.75/1.875/2 seconds
				
				
					DID YOU HEAR THIS? Fixed a bug where units would be hit if they had escaped the area after the cast.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Jinx
				
				
					E mana cost up and damage down.
				
				
					We’ve toned down many of Jinx’s strongest lane opponents over the past few patches, leaving her with room to rocket back into botlane prominence. Unlike more complex projects (*cough* Kog’Maw *cough*), Jinx is simply scaling up a bit too quickly. Though the patch note here says “Flame Chompers,” it’s actually more about Jinx’s rockets. If she wants to keep feeding mana to Fishbones, she’ll need to be more careful about how often she drops her traps.
				
				
					E - Flame Chompers!
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 80/135/190/245/300 ⇒ 70/120/170/220/270
				
				
					COST 50 mana at all ranks ⇒ 70 mana at all ranks
				
				
					MOUTHGUARDS Enemies now only take damage from one Flame Chomper per cast, even if they’re hit by multiple explosions
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Nunu
				
				
					Q gives a stacking buff instead of a unique buff for eating certain monsters. R slow increases over time.
				
				
					Nunu’s always been an oddball, but over time he hasn’t been able to successfully fulfil his niche - a supportive counter-jungler - without being outshined by other options. While Nunu’s objective control is almost without parallel, his ‘mini-game’ of consuming specific camps left him in a state where many of the stats he needed to compete sometimes simply weren’t available to him. We still want Nunu to feel rewarded for feeding his Yeti, so we’re altering the buffs to align them more towards what Nunu actually wants. Add in changes to the impact and usability of Absolute Zero and you’ve got an update to keep League’s original duo from feeling left out in the cold.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 56.86 ⇒ 59
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH STAT 3.45 ⇒ 4
				
				
					YETI GEAR Nunu’s recommended items have been updated
				
				
					Passive - Visionary
				
				
					newREALLY FEELING IT Nunu now begins the game with Visionary, and refreshes the buff upon recalling or respawning
				
				
					Q - Consume
				
				
					COOLDOWN 13/12/11/10/9 seconds ⇒ 12/11/10/9/8 seconds
				
				
					removedPICKY EATER Nunu no longer receives unique benefits for casting Consume on certain neutral monsters
				
				
					newFEED THE YETI Every large monster consumed feeds Willump, granting him a stack of Well Fed. Each stack of Well Fed grants Nunu 10 movement speed out of combat, 3% maximum health and size (stacking 5 times). Stacks refresh on each cast of Consume, falling off every 50/55/60/65/70 seconds.
				
				
					CONSUMPTION HULK Fixed a bug where bonus health received from Consume didn’t stack with Cinderhulk
				
				
					R - Absolute Zero
				
				
					SLOW 50% ⇒ 50%, increasing to 95% over the channel duration
				
				
					removedCAST TIME 0.25 seconds ⇒ No cast time
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Taliyah
				
				
					Base health regen up. Q cooldown and Worked Ground duration reduced.
				
				
					A few patches ago, we saw Taliyah roaming too often and with too little setup. Since then, we’ve upped the cooldown on Taliyah’s ultimate and weakened her waveclear, forcing her to work harder to leave lane. With less time spent roaming she’s scrapping more often, and her trading is somewhat below the curve for mid lane. Her overall damage isn’t too far off from where it needs to be, but she has to pick her trades a bit too carefully right now.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE HEALTH REGEN 6 ⇒ 7
				
				
					ITEMWEAVING Taliyah’s recommended items have been updated
				
				
					Q - Threaded Volley
				
				
					COOLDOWN 10/8.5/7/5.5/4 seconds ⇒ 9/7.5/6/4.5/3 seconds
				
				
					WORKED GROUND DURATION 140 seconds ⇒ 120 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Vladimir
				
				
					Q and E AP ratios up. Q minion healing down. E health scaling down.
				
				
					 Vladimir is in quite the pickle right now. In competitive play, he’s seen several nerfs in a row and still remains a pretty dominant pick. And yet for the vast majority of players, Vladimir is struggling to keep up with other champions. Safety is much more abusable in organized play, and so we’re continuing to trim safety from Vladimir’s kit, but using that leeway to give him power in return.
					 Vladimir puts himself at risk of being bursted the more he uses his abilities ` but can pull himself back from the brink of death (high sustain). Building tanky nullifies a lot of that gameplay by making Vladimir too hard to burst, resulting in an extremely safe champion. We want to continue to highlight the risk in Vladimir’s kit, and that means incentivizing him to build more damage, rather than relying on tank builds.
				
				
					Q - Transfusion
				
				
					HEAL RATIO 0.15 ability power ⇒ 0.35 ability power
				
				
					CRIMSON RUSH HEALING BONUS 50% effective vs minions ⇒ 35% effective vs minions
				
				
					E - Tides of Blood
				
				
					MAXIMUM RATIO 0.8 maximum health + 0.7 ability power ⇒ 0.6 maximum health + 1.0 ability power (minimum ratio and charge-up cost unchanged)
				
				
					MISSILE WIDTH 40 ⇒ 60
				
				
					MISSILES SPAWNED 20 ⇒ 15
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Yorick
				
				
					Ghouls follow Yorick through Teleport. E no longer marks minions.
				
				
					With two patches on the Rift, we’re happy to continue to watch players learn how to play as and against him before making any balance changes. In the meantime, we’re hitting a few usability pain points to ease occasional frustrations of Yorick players.
				
				
					General
				
				
					NO PET LEFT BEHIND Mistwalkers and the Maiden will now teleport with Yorick if they were following him (Does not occur if they were pushing a lane)
				
				
					Passive - Shepherd of Souls
				
				
					COLD ZOMBIES Threshold for summoning graves set to 4 on Howling Abyss
				
				
					W - Dark Procession
				
				
					DARK USABILITY Yorick will now cast at his maximum range if Dark Procession is cast outside of its maximum range
				
				
					E - Mourning Mist
				
				
					GHOULS DON’T NEED GOLD Now only marks champions and monsters
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kog'Maw
				
				
					W animation improved to match updated effect.
				
				
					Getting this out of the way: we don’t have buffs for Kog this patch, and that’s why he’s at the bottom (your winrate joke goes here). Reverting an update after it’s settled is really a new update in itself, so we expected Kog’Maw’s performance to drop while players re-adjust to the attack speed cap. We’re holding off on the (im)balanced call until he stabilizes, since hasty changes now will just incur more adjustments down the road.
					That aside, Bio-Arcane Barrage’s visuals felt pretty out of place with the changed functionality. We’ve fixed them up!
				
				
					W - Bio-Arcane Barrage
				
				
					NEW?SPIFFY SPITTING Made Bio-Arcane Barrage’s attack animation cool again
				
				
					LION VOMIT Updated Lion Dance Kog’Maw’s hit particles for even more fireworks
				
				
					8 SECONDS Updated Bio-Arcane Barrage’s visual effects across skins to match the new duration
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Shyvana
				
				
					Q animation visually sped up.
				
				
					A while back, we adjusted Twin Bite’s animation for her base skin. While the actual timing of Shyvana’s damage didn’t change, her swings felt a bit slower. We’ve sped the animation up a bit to give back some of Twin Bite’s snappy feeling (though again, no impact on actual damage timing).
				
				
					AESTHETICS Twin Bite’s animation has been visually sped up

			Summoner’s Rift
		
	
		
			
				
					Baron Nashor
				
				
					Knockback when dashing over Baron reduced.
				
				
					Let’s go back in time to the Summoner’s Rift update. In that update, we made Baron Nashor much, much bigger to make the encounter feel appropriately epic. As a result, crafty playtesters could ‘hide’ inside Baron through positioning tricks. We gave Baron a knockback to avoid these scenarios before we shipped the update.
					Cut to today. We took a look at Baron’s mechanics and felt the full second is a bit overkill for what the knockback is trying to do. While not the largest problem in the world, it does make a few champs feel bad about using their full suite of abilities to fight the Rift’s biggest bad. That doesn’t explain why some of you feel the need to dash right on top of a giant void worm, but hey, more power to you.
				
				
					DASH COLLISION KNOCKBACK 1 second ⇒ 0.33 seconds

			Twisted Treeline
		
	
		
			
				
					Outer Turrets
				
				
					Outer turret vision range decreased to match attack range.
				
				
					It’s been quite a while since we added outer turrets to Twisted Treeline with the goal of moving players further into lane (and fighting distance of one another). Outer turrets did what we wanted, but had the side effect of making the early game a bit too safe via the added vision. Given Treeline’s smaller size, we’re narrowing outer turret vision range to match their attack range. (This is how Howling Abyss turrets work, by the way!)
				
				
					OUTER TURRET VISION RANGE 1095 ⇒ 775

			Basic Attack Lock-In
		
	
		
			
				
					Basic attack canceling is now more consistent.
				
				
					At higher levels of play, canceling the backend of basic attack animations is crucial to everything from trading to kiting. Currently, playing around basic attack animations is a bit too suspect to situational variations like a slight spike in lag or the outer edge of Frozen Heart’s aura. We want the behavior around animation cancelling to be a smidgen (about .06 seconds) more consistent, so that more players can learn and master this mechanic.
				
				
					NO CANCELLATIONS Movement orders issued .03 seconds before a basic attack fires will no longer cancel it. The movement will now occur after the attack fires.

				The basic attack component of Hecarim’s E - Devastating Charge can now critically strike, in line with similar abilities such as Nasus’s Q
					
					Pantheon is no longer locked out of his active items if he dies during R - Grand Skyfall’s channel
					
					Fixed a number of bugs where various short-range dash abilities (ex. Riven’s E - Valor, Hextech Protobelt-01) and knock-back effects (ex. Janna’s R - Monsoon) that can’t move champions across normal terrain were able to move them over player-created terrain. This is technically a Jarvan buff.
					
					Additionally fixed a few spots where Vayne’s Q - Tumble was able to move across ledges
					
					Fixed an edge case where Tryndamere’s E - Spinning Slash could damage allies he spins through if they were directly on top of an enemy unit
					
					Fixed a bug where Rift Herald couldn’t disable Garen’s Passive - Perseverance after Perseverance 'ranked up' at level 11
					
					Kled can now issue pings during R - Chaaaaaaaarge!!!
					
					Pinging active items while dead no longer displays “0 charges”
					
					Battle Bunny Riven’s sound effects for Q - Broken Wings and R - Wind Slash have been restored
					
					Master Arcanist Ziggs’s Q - Bouncing Bomb explosion visuals have been restored
					
					Cottontail Fizz’s health bar has been moved up to match his base skin
					
					Lunar Goddess Diana’s health bar has been moved up to match her base skin
					
				
					This last one’s not really a bug so much as us getting ahead of something that might feel like a bug down the road:

		Got patching problems? Check the Boards for tips and solutions!
	
	
		Greetings, Summoners.
		Welcome to 6.19, the one where we return to our normal programming. That means two things: first, we can tackle a few projects deemed too risky for patches hyper-focused on Worlds, and second, our balance focus has returned to standard calibration.
		So, what’ve we got? The biggest change of the patch is a partial revert of last year’s update to Kog’Maw. The context there is twice as long as this foreword, so we’ll gloss over the topic here. Void doggos aside, we’re also looking at champs whose strengths or weaknesses are out of whack. We’ve got a few late-game champs who are taking over too early (Soraka, Cassiopeia) as well as a few champs who are falling off too hard as the game progresses (Corki, Mundo). That’s no bueno, so we’re taking steps to even things out.
		Toss in a few quality-of-life and usability features and we’ve got ourselves a patch! May your HUD pings be plentiful, your item undos less painful, and your summoner spells safe from “user error” at the start of the game.
		Good luck, have fun.P.S. - you’ll notice Kog’Maw out of alphabetical order. We’re going to start using the top of the Champions list to ‘feature’ large or more contentious changes. We’ve dabbled with this before, but now it’s explicit. Top of the notes? It’s a Big Deal (™)

			Champions
		
	
		
			
				
				
					Kog'Maw
				
				
					Q and W have been reverted to their pre-update paradigms.
				
				
					Let’s start with the bottom line: Kog’Maw’s being partially reverted to his pre-2016 status. While we’ve had champions that take a couple of passes to get right (...Ryze), this is the first time we’ve actually gone back on a Champion Update. To understand how we got here, let’s take it all the way back to last year’s pre-season.
					Our goal for the Marskman update was to create strategic identities for them outside of ‘who does the most damage’. What does each marksman do that their classmates don’t? Kog’Maw already had an answer to that question: be the glass cannon, demanding an entire team’s resources to support. So rather than create a distinct identity, we took a different approach: sharpen the one he already had. If ‘glass cannon’ was cool, could we push things further and make a ‘glass turret’?
					10 months and 5 attacks per second later, how did that shake out? Well, Kog’s gameplay has actually moved away from the niche he previously filled. Transforming into an immobile turret is certainly unique, but it creates a ‘feast or famine’ situation. Kog can’t move between attacks in the late game, so either he mows down everyone in range, or enemies walk to safety since Kog can't keep pace. Compared to the consistent payoffs of old-school ‘Jugger-Maw’ comps, playing with today’s Kog’Maw feels too hit-or-miss.	
					As an aside, new Kog's created some warping effects on the items system. Specifically, on-hit items (Rageblade, Wit’s End, even Skirmisher’s Sabre) are balanced with the attack speed cap in mind, and Kog'Maw's pushing the strength of these effects past their designs. This puts heavy restrictions on the item system, all to support a single champ.
					All said, we’re left with two choices - continue to make concessions toward Kog’Maw’s ‘glass turret’ ideal, or hit the reset switch to a stabler (though still imperfect) Kog. The updated kit's moved too far from what made Kog’Maw special, so we opted for the latter. This transition may be choppy, as many of League’s underlying systems have changed since Kog'Maw's update, but we’ll be monitoring how he readjusts and make any changes necessary to support him.
				
				
					General
				
				
					BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.625 ⇒ 0.665
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED GROWTH STAT 3.5% ⇒ 2.65%
				
				
					Q - Caustic Spittle
				
				
					new?BONUS ATTACK SPEED Now grants 15/20/25/30/35% attack speed
				
				
					updatedW - Bio-Arcane Barrage
				
				
					W no longer doubles Kog’s attack speed or the attack speed cap, but deals more max health per hit, has a higher range early, and lasts longer.
				
				
					removedULTRA RAPID KOG’MAW No longer doubles Kog’Maw’s attack speed, increases his attack speed cap to 5.0, or decreases his cast times by 50%
				
				
					removedFLAT MAGIC DAMAGE No longer deals 4/8/12/16/20 bonus magic damage per basic attack
				
				
					MAX HEALTH DAMAGE 2% of the target’s maximum health ⇒ 2/3/4/5/6% of the target’s maximum health
				
				
					MAX HEALTH DAMAGE RATIO 0.75% max health per 100 ability power ⇒ 1% max health per 100 ability power
				
				
					BONUS RANGE 90/120/150/180/210 ⇒ 130/150/170/190/210
				
				
					COOLDOWN 13/11.5/10/8.5/7 seconds ⇒ 17 second at all ranks
				
				
					new?COOLDOWN PARADIGM Bio-Arcane Barrage’s cooldown begins on cast, rather than when the effect ends
				
				
					DURATION 6 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 8 seconds at all ranks
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Anivia
				
				
					E damage lowered.
				
				
					Anivia’s historically succeeded by establishing control over the battlefield through persistent threat of AoE lockdown. Frostbite is her follow-through when she lands a crowd control ability, but it hits so hard it’s single-handedly winning trades for her. We’re toning Frostbite’s damage down so Anivia has to utilize her entire kit to succeed, rather than leaning on a single ability.
				
				
					E - Frostbite
				
				
					DAMAGE 55/85/115/145/175 ⇒ 50/75/100/125/150
				
				
					CHILLED DAMAGE 110/170/230/290/350 ⇒ 100/150/200/250/300
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Aurelion Sol
				
				
					Passive damage up, W damage down. W’s cost adjusted. E no longer requires build-up to cast.
				
				
					Aurelion Sol is a sassy dragon who favors extended fights where he can pummel enemies with his stars. The catch is that, as an innately-squishy champ, Aurelion has to survive those encounters himself. Investing in defenses is the obvious solution to the problem, but comes at the tradeoff of deferring more damage-focused purchases. As it turns out, Aurelion doesn't need ability power to be a mid-game threat due to how much base damage he gets from Celestial Expansion rank-ups.
					That said, Aurelion’s damage ends up in a reasonable spot once his build is balanced out in the late-game with a mix of offense and defense, and we don’t want to take that away. So, instead of a straight-up nerf, we’re moving base values around to smooth Aurelion’s damage progression over the game. If he wants to continue to be a mid-game damage threat, he'll now need to make riskier purchases early on.
					On an entirely separate note, we've got a set of usability improvements for Comet of Legend. Removing Escape Velocity as a requirement to press E is a straight-up buff, but there are a few quality-of-life improvements bundled in as well. Fly high, Aurelion Sol.
				
				
					Passive - Center of the Universe
				
				
					DAMAGE 20-97 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 20-130 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					W - Celestial Expansion
				
				
					BONUS DAMAGE 10/20/30/40/50 ⇒ 5/10/15/20/25
				
				
					COST 40 + 16/22/28/34/40 mana per second ⇒ 40 + 22/24/26/28/30 mana per second
				
				
					E - Comet of Legend
				
				
					removedESCAPE VELOCITY Aurelion Sol may now cast Comet of Legend any time outside of combat (goes on 5 second cooldown when taking damage)
				
				
					BLASTOFF Aurelion now takes flight immediately, even if cast outside the cast range
				
				
					AUTOCORRECT When cast during Comet of Legend, Starsurge now travels in the same direction as Aurelion Sol if it was cast just slightly off-angle
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Cassiopeia
				
				
					W cast range reduced. E healing down.
				
				
					We’ve had this conversation a few times since mid-season, but to restate one of our beliefs: late-game characters like Cassiopeia need to have windows of interaction in the early game so opponents have a fair chance of winning. As Cass players learned to play around their bootless immobility, those windows have gradually closed. With finer mastery over their combat ranges, Cassiopeia players are now controlling too much of the battlefield from too far a distance, all the while sustaining through the damage opponents do manage to land. We’re heightening the risks Cassiopeia needs to take in lane to re-open those windows of interaction necessary to justify her late-game hyperscaling.
				
				
					Passive - Serpentine Grace
				
				
					AN UNNECESSARY PATCH NOTE Cassiopeia still can’t wear boots. We thought you’d like to know.
				
				
					W - Miasma
				
				
					CAST RANGE 900 ⇒ 800
				
				
					E - Twin Fang
				
				
					HEALING ON POISONED TARGETS 5/10/15/20/25 ⇒ 5-22 (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Corki
				
				
					Attack damage per level up.
				
				
					Sheen buff? Sheen buff.
					...More seriously, Corki’s been struggling ever since his Patch 6.3 nerf, but zooming out a bit brings us to a bigger question: what is Corki? Is he a mage who cares about his auto attacks? Is he a marksman who relies on spells? That tension is at the root of Corki’s unclear identity. Patch 6.3 framed Corki as the least marksman-y marksman, able to get by without reliance on his basic attacks. However, there is a threshold where that goes too far, and Corki has crossed it. Corki doesn’t need to be a carry who can get away with just standing and attacking, but his Trinity empowered autos between spells should be more explosive.
				
				
					General
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH STAT 2.5 ⇒ 3.5
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE AT LEVEL 18 98.5 ⇒ 115.5
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Dr. Mundo
				
				
					E damage up, cooldown reduced.
				
				
					When we last visited Dr. Mundo, the early game sustain of Grasp of the Undying was making it difficult to punish his laning phase. At the time, we nerfed his early damage so that opponents could win trades and set him behind. With Grasp now significantly weaker, Mundo is missing out on damage at all stages of the game. When Mundo scales into the late game he still goes where he pleases, but without damage, his opponents don’t care.
				
				
					E - Masochism
				
				
					MINIMUM DAMAGE 20/40/60/80/100 ⇒ 30/50/70/90/110
				
				
					MAXIMUM DAMAGE 40/80/120/160/200 ⇒ 60/100/140/180/220
				
				
					COOLDOWN 7 seconds ⇒ 6 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Kled
				
				
					Kled does full damage to monsters and minions while dismounted. R’s range and duration decreased.
				
				
					This is Kled’s first visit to the patch notes, so we’ll share our initial read on him. He’s hitting the fantasy of scrappy, aggressive insanity we envisioned, but is more feast-or-famine than we’d like in terms of overall performance.
					Specifically, Kled runs away with even small leads due to how much power is packed into CHAAAAAAAARGE!!! Its giant range gives Kled a quick trip back top after recalling (often in the form of ganking his own lane), and regardless of where Kled’s headed, allies have an eternity to decide whether to come along for the ride or not. But if Kled falls behind, remounting Skaarl can feel like an impossible task. Farming to build courage is meant to be risky, but it’s also complicated since Kled’s last-hit threshold changes while dismounted. If he can’t tell which risks are worth taking, he just doesn’t take risks.
					To even the Cantankerous Cavalier out, we’re asking Kled and his team put a little more footwork into making strong CHAAAAAAAARGE plays, while throwing him a bone when Skaarl’s abandoned him.
				
				
					Passive - Skaarl, the Cowardly Lizard
				
				
					removedDISMOUNTED DAMAGE REDUCTION Kled’s basic attack damage against minions and monsters is no longer reduced by 20%
				
				
					R - Chaaaaaaaarge!!!
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED TRAIL DURATION 8 seconds ⇒ 6 seconds
				
				
					RANGE 4500 at all ranks ⇒ 3500/4000/4500
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Leona
				
				
					Whoops.
				
				
					E - Zenith Blade
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug preventing Leona from Flashing during Zenith Blade’s cast time
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Singed
				
				
					Poison ticks much faster but damage over time is unchanged.
				
				
					This one’s pretty simple. A smoother tick rate makes Poison Trail’s payoff more consistently reflect how well Singed was able to outmaneuver his opponents (or how quickly opponents were able to escape).
				
				
					Q - Poison Trail
				
				
					TICKS PER SECOND 1 ⇒ 4
				
				
					DAMAGE PER SECOND Unchanged
				
				
					W - Mega Adhesive
				
				
					A STICKY SITUATION Fixed a bug where Mega Adhesive lasted 0.5 seconds longer than intended
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Soraka
				
				
					W cooldown increased at early ranks.
				
				
					Killing an opponent through Soraka’s barrage of heals can feel like an exercise in futility. We like her ability to sustain an ally through otherwise lethal damage in teamfights, where one positioning mistake can spell death for the squishy healer. But in lane - where she can hang way back and sustain - punishing Soraka without an aggressive support like Blitzcrank or Leona can be pretty frustrating. The low early cooldown on Soraka’s heal prevents opposing lanes from meaningfully trading with her carry, so we want the sustain train to start off slower before picking up steam.
				
				
					W - Astral Infusion
				
				
					COOLDOWN 4/3.5/3/2.5/2 seconds ⇒ 8/6.5/5/3.5/2 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Twitch
				
				
					Q attack speed down.
				
				
					While not much has changed in recent history for Twitch himself, the game around him has become more favorable to the Plague Rat across the season. As a result, he’s steadily snuck his way to the top of the charts. Given how powerful Twitch’s assassination potential is when he ults out of stealth (Q attack speed times R bonus damage equals murder!) we’re giving opponents a bit more ground to stand on when Twitch doesn’t have Rat-ta-tat-tat to amplify his damage.
				
				
					Q - Ambush
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED 30/40/50/60/70% ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				
					Udyr
				
				
					R’s cone proc deals more damage but its area-of-effect burn ticks one less time.
				
				
					Udyr’s abilities each follow a similar pattern: an impactful activation followed by a smaller sustained effect. Skilled Udyr players are rewarded for managing their ability cooldowns well, maximizing the impact of these activations. For that ability management to feel good, it’s important that the active portions of the ability be strong - and feel satisfying - compared to the passives. Phoenix stance isn’t living up to that expectation, with the passive burn actually contributing more damage than the on-hit cone. Giving Udyr slightly more explosive damage - rather than a slow burn - should help Udyr players feel the impact of their abilities more clearly.
				
				
					R - Phoenix Stance
				
				
					PROC DAMAGE 25/60/95/130/165 ⇒ 40/80/120/160/200
				
				
					BURN DURATION 5 ticks over 5 seconds ⇒ 4 ticks over 4 seconds
				
				
					BURN DAMAGE PER TICK 10/20/30/40/50 (unchanged)
				
				
					CLARITY Phoenix Stance’s burn visual effects updated to better fit the area of effect

			Item Shop
		
	
		
			
				
					A bunch of quality of life and usability improvements!
				
				
					Given how well-received the HUD pings were, we decided to spend some time giving a bit of love to the item shop as well.
				
				
					Undo Purchase
				
				
					This one needs a bit context. Undoing a purchase subtracts health to avoid weird abuse cases around buying a regen-increasing item to heal faster, undoing the pickup, then buying something else. But, the time lost still sucks. Well, not anymore!
				
				
					BUYER’S REMORSE Undoing a purchase still subtracts health gained since the original purchase, but now adds back the health you would’ve regenerated if you hadn’t made the purchase in the first place
				
				
					Item Pings
				
				
					LET ME LAST HIT Pinging an item in the shop generates a chat message letting your team know how much gold you need to purchase the item
				
				
					PERIPHERAL PINGING You can now use normal pings on the map outside the item shop window
				
				
					Fast Selling
				
				
					IT’S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE Items can now be sold by right-clicking them in the shop window inventory

					A summary of pings added since 6.14.
				
				
					We’ve quietly made a bunch of fixes and additions to the HUD pings feature since it launched in 6.14. So.. here, have some documentation.

					Lee Sin's Q2 - Resonating Strike and W1 - Safeguard no longer cause him to dash directly on top of his target
					
					Zyra's plants now properly count as pets, rather than area-of-effect abilities, for the slow effect of Rylai's Crystal Scepter
					
					Fixed a bug that allowed Alistar to basic attack during W - Headbutt's animation
