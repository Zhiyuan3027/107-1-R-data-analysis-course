  Welcome to 8.20. This patch brings an update to League's most daring, well-dressed, genius, athletic, glory-bound, handsome explorer, Ezreal! (His words.) His gameplay is undergoing a less drastic
    transformation than past updates, but you'll look a heck of a lot better while slinging skillshots and nabbing bounties—and you still won't need a map.*
    *Please always pay attention to your minimap.
    
Other than that, this one's a pretty quiet patch as we switch gears behind the scenes from Worlds balancing toward preseason preparations. We're mainly tuning a few things to be a little less lethal in the early/mid-game, other than Nami or Sion who should ideally die at least sometimes (up from never).
    
That's it! Get back to climbing ranked and watching Worlds!

          Ezreal
          W has been redesigned.
          Ezreal's champion update brings some significant visual, audio, and lore level-ups to the Prodigal Explorer. Ezreal's update differs from other VGUs in the gameplay department: His kit's held up well
            over the years, and the only ability that needed a makeover was his W, Essence Flux. Within a suite of spells that make Ezreal feel like an ace spellslinger, Essence Flux felt unremarkable… when it was even noticed. We've given the
            Prodigal Explorer a new W that has a more appreciable place in his kit and even adds a few new decisions for Ezreal players to consider.We'd be remiss not to mention AP Ezreal, a playstyle we want to preserve with this update. Though the new Essence Flux plays quite differently than a pass-through skillshot, it still packs a punch with some AP itemization. It also gives AP Ezreal much stronger structure damage as well as more reliability from Arcane Shift.

            General
            UPDATED
              Ezreal and his skins have all received full visual and audio updates!
            
            SPLASH
              Base, Frosted, TPA, Debonair, Ace of Spades, and Arcade Ezreal's splashes have been altered to match Ezreal's new design. Nottingham, Striker, Explorer, and Pulsefire Ezreal have received brand new splashes. You can find them all on League Displays!

          Ahri
          R cooldown increased early.
          Given how aggressively Ahri can snowball early leads into quick wins, we're reducing how often Spirit Rush lets her threaten her opponent in lane. This should give the enemy midlaner a bit more
            breathing room to recover and the enemy team more opportunity to shut Ahri down while her dashes are unavailable.

          Empowered E damage decreased early. R damage decreased.

          Graves
          Base AD decreased.
          For how well he scales, Graves takes over early games too reliably—even for an early-game-oriented champion.

          Jhin
          Hail of Blades no longer applies to Jhin's first basic attack.
          Don't let the \"Bugfix\" tag below fool you, this is a pretty substantial power-down to Hail of Blades Jhin. Bonus attack speed increases both Jhin's attack damage and the movement speed he gets from
            critical strikes, so while most champions would be relatively unimpacted by Hail of Blades' 75-125% bonus attack speed buffing their first basic attack, Jhin's been reaping real benefits from the bug.

          Passive - Whisper
          BUGFIX
            Hail of Blades no longer applies to Jhin's first basic attack (the one that procs it). It still properly applies to the following basic attacks as intended. (Behavior is now consistent with everyone else.)
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Nami
          W heal decreased.
          We're making Nami and her carry less resilient to threats from aggressive enemy lanes.

          Sion
          Base health regen decreased.
          Less health regen means Sion will have to rely more on his shield and health bonuses from last-hitting to stay healthy in lane.

          Dark Harvest

          We want to preserve Dark Harvest's late-game scaling, but it shouldn't be a go-to pick for early/mid-game damage on top of that.

Welcome to the second round of changes focused on the World Championship, which starts next week! You might be wondering where the massive pro patch is this year—last year’s World’s patch had 23 changes, after all. This patch, rather than trimming power from the top picks in pro play we’ve been seeing, we’re going to be giving a few nudges to other champions that should help keep them in check. We don’t want to invalidate practice the pros have been putting in for the largest tournament of the year, so we’re just going to see if we can give them a few more options to consider. For buffs, we’re focusing on champions who could use a little extra power for competitive viability who also have some breathing room for the rest of us who haven't reached pro status (yet). We’ll follow up if anything gets out of hand.We're also including a care package of visual and audio updates for a few older champions and effects. This should spruce things up both in your games and on your screens as you watch the tournament unfold. Let’s get into it.

Mid-Patch Updates

9/26/2018 Balance Update

Fiora
Adjusting Fiora's passive numbers to account for an 8.18 bug that made her buff less impactful than intended.

VITAL HEALING
35-110
 ⇒ 
40-115




Back to top

Champions
Darius

W base damage increased. E armor penetration increased.

As a valuable counter pick to tanks in top lane, we’re looking to help Darius cleave through some of that armor to encourage teams to think strategically when drafting top lane champions. Although it’s somewhat generic power, percentage armor penetration is considerably more effective against champions like Cho’gath and Ornn than against other fighters like Camille or Aatrox.  

W - Crippling Strike
RATIO
40/45/50/55/60% total attack damage
⇒
50/55/60/65/70% total attack damage

E - Apprehend
Passive Armor Penetration
10/15/20/25/30%
⇒
15/20/25/30/35%





Fiora

Healing from passive procs increased. 

Fiora is a really sharp champion, with matchups where she dominates and matchups where she struggles to gain an edge. We’re being careful with her, but our changes in 8.17 still haven’t gone far enough to reward aggressive play in lane. Increasing the sustain she gets when going for vital procs on her opponents should help resolve this.  

Passive - Duelist's Dance
Vital Healing
25-110
⇒
35-110


Q - Lunge
BUGFIX
Lunge will once again correctly prioritize champions and vital procs over killable minions.




Kha'Zix

Passive damage buffed. W slow increased.

Kha’Zix has been struggling since our changes to his evolved R in patch 8.11. We’d like  to give it a bit more oomph in a way that relies on the clever use of ultimate casts to eke out the full value. We’re also amping up the utility of Void Spikes to help Kha’Zix set up plays in ways that aren’t just… murdering you faster.

Passive - Unseen Threat
Bonus Attack Damage Ratio

⇒
0.4


W - Void Spike
EVOLVED NON-ISOLATED SLOW

⇒

EVOLVED ISOLATED SLOW

Elise
W and E cooldown decreased in Spider Form.

Elise used to dominate the early game and facilitate aggressive plays across the map. We want to bring that back, so we’re decreasing the cooldown on some of her playmaking tools so she can more frequently seek out risky opportunities to dominate her opponents.

W - Skittering Frenzy
COOLDOWN
12 seconds
⇒
10 seconds


E - Rappel
COOLDOWN
26/24/22/20/18 seconds
⇒
22/21/20/19/18 seconds




Jarvan IV

Passive cooldown decreased.

Jarvan IV has been pretty absent from the meta for the past year and needs a bit more power for players who want to flex him into top lane or jungle. Passive procs enable a faster clear and also encourage an aggressive trading pattern if played in the top lane.

Passive - Martial Cadence
new
Martial Cadence now has a visual effect indicating its per target cooldown

PER TARGET COOLDOWN
10/8/6 at levels 1/7/13
⇒
6 at all levels

BUGFIX
Tiamat passive will now consistently work when hitting a target with Martial Cadence




Nunu & Willump

AP scaling on Q’s heal increased. E AP ratio increased.

Since Nunu & Willump’s release, we’ve seen a large number of players trying for the super-hype Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark AP snowball builds. While his tank build is seeing far more success, we want to try to support the fun playstyle that meshes well with their whimsical thematic. 

Q - Consume
HEALING RATIO
0.5 ability power
⇒
0.70 ability power

BUGFIX
Tooltip now accurately reflects how much healing Nunu and Willump get from champions


E - Snowball Barrage
MAX 9 SNOWBALL HIT ABILITY POWER RATIO
0.45 ability power
⇒
0.54 ability power

WILLUMP’S TURN (ROOT DAMAGE)
0.5 ability power
⇒
0.8 ability power


W - Biggest Snowball Ever!
new
Willumps transition to walking after he finishes rolling his snowball will now feel smoother.





Janna

Passive movement speed to damage conversion increased.

Janna is currently struggling to find a home in the bot lane in a meta dominated by some of her beefier counterparts. Her defensive attributes are already as powerful as we’re comfortable pushing them right now. We’re increasing her early game poke damage for players that are able to play her aggressively and want to harass their opponents every chance they get.

Passive - Tailwind
Bonus movespeed conversion to damage
15/25/35% at levels 1/7/13
⇒
25/35% at levels 1/10
 



Thresh

Q mana cost and early cooldown decreased.

Against a cast of champions that can reliably shut Thresh out of making aggressive plays in lane, he needs more opportunities to throw hooks in the early stages of the game. We don’t want to make his hooks hit harder, or cc for longer, so we’re just bumping up how frequently he can cast them.

Q - Death Sentence
MANA COST
80
⇒
60

COOLDOWN
20/18/16/14/12
⇒
16/15/14/13/12




Pyke
Early ult damage increased.

Pyke’s performance scales down pretty steeply when played against higher-tier opponents who more frequently dodge his fairly projected abilities. We think his reliability is in a pretty solid spot, but want to increase the damage payout Pyke gets for hitting good ults that help close out fights. This power only impacts his early and mid game, and his damage from levels 11-18 is unchanged.  

R - Death From Below
Base Damage (breaks even at level 11)
200 / 250 / 300 / 350 / 400 / 450 / 475 / 500 / 525 / 550 / 575 / 590 / 605
⇒
250 / 290 / 330 / 370 / 410 / 450 / 475 / 500 / 525 / 550 / 575 / 590 / 605




Tahm Kench

Base HP down; HP per level up.

Similar to Braum last patch, we’re looking to drain some of Tahm Kench’s baseline sturdiness. Reducing Tahm’s base HP should make him rely more on his defensive tools to find success in lane, while increasing his HP gained per level will make it slightly easier for him to wade into the enemy team late game.


Base Stats 
Health
610
⇒
540

Health Growth
95
⇒
102


W - Devour
BUGFIX
Allies Tahm Kench has devoured will no longer sometimes be targetable when first swallowed.




Kog'Maw

Base movement speed increased. R range increased.

In a meta that often sees two or more tanks on a team and short-range ADCs in bot lane, Kog’Maw has been surprisingly absent. We’re giving him some base movement speed to help him kite aggressively and go for trades against some of those short-range champions like Kai’sa and Xayah. Early game buffs to his ult’s range will also help him chase down opponents after ganks or trades. 

Base Stats
Movement Speed
325

Items
		
			
				
				Liandry's Torment

Passive max HP burn increased. AP decreased.

Liandry’s has a pretty clear purpose—build it when you have damage over time and CC in your kit, or when the enemy has a really tanky team. While it has a solid set of core users who meet the first condition, it could do a better job of dealing with multiple tanks. We’re adding more max HP burn to address this while reducing its AP to limit burst power slightly.

Normal Draft matchmaking
Also in preparation for Ranked 2019, we’re now previewing positional matchmaking in Normal Draft only. This means you’ll be matched based on the position you were assigned instead of just having one rating in the background. This should make matchmaking better across the board, and tangibly better when playing secondary and autofilled games. We’re also testing position detection, which determines what position you actually played on the end of game screen. Let us know if it does you wrong.

  8.18 brings us the first wave of changes focused on the World Championship later this year. In some cases, this means reining in outliers who are dominating pick-ban (as well as champs likely to take over
    once those outliers are addressed). Other times, it means buffing champs who are on the cusp of consideration—picks we nerfed earlier in the season, in a few cases. 8.19 will contain another round of these changes.
  Back to the here and now, the Nexus Blitz alpha ends with 8.18, but we aren't leaving you high and dry. Odyssey, our newest event, is here, so join the crew and smash some space nerds!

    Nexus Blitz Alpha
    
      
        
          The Nexus Blitz Alpha ends with patch 8.18. Thanks to everyone who tried out the mode and gave us feedback! We'll be back soon with a rundown of how things went and where we're going next.

    Champions
    
      
        
          Aatrox
          E passive healing increased at later ranks. R bonus attack damage increased at later ranks.
          Our last set of Aatrox changes brought his lane bullying under control, giving us room to improve his scaling into later phases of the game.

          E - Umbral Dash
          PASSIVE HEALING VS CHAMPIONS
            20/21.25/22.5/23.75/25%
            ⇒
            20/22.5/25/27.5/30%
          

          R - World Ender
          BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE
            20/22.5/25%
            ⇒
            20/25/30%
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Akali
          R base damage decreased.
          Akali is too reliably snagging kills when she comes into a fight with all her tools available. We're trimming damage off the lower-counterplay part of her all-in to keep her as untouched as possible
            in other situations.

          R - Perfect Execution
          BASE DAMAGE (BOTH CASTS)
            120/180/240
            ⇒
            100/150/200
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Braum
          Base health decreased.
          We're draining some of Braum's baseline sturdiness to make him more reliant on his defensive cooldowns while preserving the high moments he's picked for among the tanky support lineup.

          Base stats
          BASE HEALTH
            576.6
            ⇒
            540
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Kai'Sa
          Passive damage decreased at later levels.
          Reducing Kai'Sa's tank-busting prowess at later phases of the game.

          Passive - Caustic Wounds
          PROC DAMAGE
            15-20% target's missing health (at levels 1-18)
            ⇒
            15% target's missing health (at all levels)
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Lucian
          Q damage ratio increased at later ranks.
          We nerfed Lucian's baseline damage a few patches back when he emerged as a premier midseason bot laner. Given the rebalancing that's happened around him, he could stand to recoup some of that damage,
            but we don't want to put him right back on top again. Piercing Light is a good candidate for the power we're looking to add back in, given opponents have some ability to dodge—or worst case, Flash—it. 

          Q - Piercing Light
          DAMAGE RATIO
            0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9/1.0 bonus attack damage
            ⇒
            0.6/0.75/0.9/1.05/1.2 bonus attack damage
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Renekton
          Empowered E damage increased. Empowered E armor reduction increased at early ranks. 
          We're raising Renekton’s empowered E's potential as a means for him to throw his early-game strength around in lane, widening the range of lane matchups he can confidently play into. These changes
            also amplify the fallback value empowered E provides in games where Renekton falls behind.

          E - Slice and Dice
          EMPOWERED DICE DAMAGE
            60/105/150/195/240
            ⇒
            70/115/160/205/250
          
          EMPOWERED DICE ARMOR REDUCTION
            15/20/25/30/35%
            ⇒
            25/27.5/30/32.5/35%
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Ryze
          Empowered W root duration decreased.
          Ryze's pro-vs-normal discrepancy has again led to ubiquitous presence in competitive play despite rough performances everywhere else. We're targeting Ryze's E-W root for a power-down as pros are most
            reliably able to coordinate successful ganks and catches around it.

          W - Rune Prison
          EMPOWERED ROOT DURATION
            2 seconds
            ⇒
            1.5 seconds
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Sejuani
          E base damage decreased. R storm slow duration decreased.
          We're reducing some of Sejuani's early clear speed and a touch of her dueling potency so she has more pronounced weaknesses against early-game junglers. We're also hitting Glacial Prison's zoning
            utility, a strength best leveraged by pro players, to keep her competitive presence in check while impacting her strength in normal play as little as possible.

          E - Permafrost
          BASE DAMAGE
            30/45/60/75/90
            ⇒
            20/35/50/65/80
          

          R - Glacial Prison
          STORM EXPLOSION SLOW DURATION
            3 seconds
            ⇒
            1 second
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Trundle
          E cooldown increased. E slow decreased at early ranks, increased at later ranks.
          Tuning down the frequency and potency of Trundle's crowd control to reduce the troll king's effectiveness at setting up ganks and favorable fights, particularly in competitive play.

          E - Pillar of Ice
          COOLDOWN
            22/20/18/16/14 seconds
            ⇒
            24/22/20/18/16 seconds
          
          SLOW PERCENT
            30/35/40/45/50%
            ⇒
            15/25/35/45/55%
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Vayne
          Q cooldown decreased at early ranks.
          More early Tumbles give Vayne more opportunities to land damage on opponents in matchups where she can be aggressive with her positioning and Q cooldowns.

          Q - Tumble
          COOLDOWN
            6/5/4/3/2 seconds
            ⇒
            4/3.5/3/2.5/2 seconds
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          Viktor
          First Hex Core upgrade cost decreased.
          Lowering the Hex Core's first upgrade cost not only gives Viktor his first item spike earlier, it also means he doesn't have to stay in lane as long before recalling for the first time. This cost
            reduction carries forward to the Hex Core's second upgrade, only evening back out when Viktor completes the Perfect Hex Core.

          Passive - Glorious Evolution
          HEX CORE MK-1 COST
            1250 gold
            ⇒
            1150 gold

    Bugfixes
    
      
        
          Fixed a bug where Nunu was sometimes invisible to enemies while rolling his W - Biggest Snowball Ever! out of fog of war
            Fixed an FPS hitching issue that occurred when Voidbringer Illaoi sucessfully Teleported while her W - Harsh Lesson attack buff was active
            Ravenous Hunter's tooltip no longer counts healing done while you're already at full health

				Annie
				Attack range increased.
				
					Right now, Annie doesn't really have gameplay outside of dumping all of her spells at once. Returning to her longer attack range lets her trade and harass with autos as an alternate pattern of aggression.
				
				
					ATTACK RANGE 575 ⇒ 625
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Bard
				R cooldown decreased.
				
					Bard's laning phase is already strong enough, but his overall gameplay could use a bit more power. We want to give everybody's favorite chime-gathering support more playmaking opportunities so that he doesn't feel barred from using his ult for fear of its long cooldown.
				
				R - Tempered Fate
				
					COOLDOWN 130/110/90 seconds ⇒ 110/95/80 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Fiora
				E crit damage on second attack increased at early ranks.
				
					Fiora's late game is pretty strong, but she could use some more dueling power in the early game to get there more often. Because, you know, duelist.
				
				E - Bladework
				
					CRIT DAMAGE ON SECOND ATTACK 140/155/170/185/200% ⇒ 160/170/180/190/200%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Garen
				Q damage decreased at later ranks.
				
					Garen's spun his way into top lane dominance as of late, and Q's early game damage leaves opponents with few opportunities to trade well.
				
				Q - Decisive Strike
				
					BASE DAMAGE 30/65/100/135/170 ⇒ 30/60/90/120/150
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Irelia
				Q damage bonus to minions increased.
				
					We're putting some laning functionality back into Irelia's Q.
				
				Q - Bladesurge
				
					INCREASED DAMAGE TO MINIONS 70% ⇒ 100%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kassadin
				R cooldown decreased at early ranks.
				
					Touching Kassadin's late game is always risky, but he has room for some more early-mid game strength.
				
				R - Riftwalk
				
					COOLDOWN 6/4/2 seconds ⇒ 5/3.5/2 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kayn
				E duration increased early. Shadow E movement speed increased.
				
					Kayn, especially as Shadow Assassin, is struggling to stay competitive with other junglers. This buff should help him move around the map (and through terrain) and extend his opportunities to pick up kills.
				
				E - Shadow Step
				
					DURATION 5/6/7/8/9 seconds ⇒ 7/7.5/8/8.5/9 seconds
				
				
					SHADOW ASSASSIN BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED 70% ⇒ 80%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Master Yi
				W cooldown decreased; damage reduction increased early.
				
					Meditate can be a strong defensive tool, but it’s often underappreciated by players who use it primarily for the heal. We're giving it a small buff to encourage its use during (rather than after) combat.
				
				W - Meditate
				
					COOLDOWN 35 seconds ⇒ 28 seconds
				
				
					DAMAGE REDUCTION 50/55/60/65/70% ⇒ 60/62.5/65/67.5/70%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rengar
				R cooldown decreased early.
				
					We want to help Rengar feel powerful, but we're also trying to tone down upfront damage in League overall. Because of this, we’re giving Rengar more chances to surprise his opponents rather than boosting his damage when he does.
				
				R - Thrill of the Hunt
				
					COOLDOWN 130/100/70 seconds ⇒ 110/90/70 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Varus
				Base health decreased; health growth increased.
				
					As a marksman with long-ranged poke, Varus should be easier to kill when opponents close the gap.
				
				Base Stats
				
					HEALTH 549 ⇒ 499
				
				
					HEALTH GROWTH 86 ⇒ 89
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Wukong
				Now has level 1 bonus attack speed.
				
					Wukong is far from the king of the jungle after the most recent round of changes. A boost to his early attack speed should help his early clears and make him more consistent on the map.
				
				Base Stats
				
					BONUS ATTACK SPEED AT LEVEL 1 0% ⇒ 8%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Yorick
				Mist Walker damage decreased.
				
					Top laners have unearthed Yorick as a dominant pick, in part due to the threat of his Mist Walkers. Players who understand the Mist Walkers' behavior and actively play around it avoid a lot of damage, while players who don't find themselves digging their own graves. We're toning down the damage of Mist Walkers to decrease his low level pubstomp potential.
				
				Mist Walkers
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH (LEVELS 2-7) 3 ⇒ 1
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH (LEVELS 8-13) 5 ⇒ 6
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH (LEVELS 14+) 10 ⇒ 11
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Taric
				Adaptive damage now defaults to physical.
				
					Taric's passive means he benefits a decent amount from his basic attacks.
				
				
					ADAPTIVE DAMAGE Now defaults to physical if Taric has no bonus attack damage or ability power

	Items
	
		
			
				
				Stormrazor
				Guaranteed crit damage decreased below 30% crit. Attack speed increased and attack damage decreased.
				
					The high amount of upfront damage in the game is something we've been looking to dial back. Last patch we trimmed a lot of the burst damage from various runes; this patch we're looking at items.
				
				
					CRITICAL STRIKE MODIFIER 160-200% (at 0-30% crit chance) ⇒ 140-200% (at 0-30% crit chance)
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED 25% ⇒ 35%
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 65 ⇒ 60
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Duskblade
				Proc damage decreased. Lethality increased.
				
					The high amount of upfront damage in the game is something we've been looking to dial back. Last patch we trimmed a lot of the burst damage from various runes; this patch we're looking at items.

	Bugfixes
	
		
			
				Fixed a bug where Phantom Dancer's Spectral Waltz passive would sometimes not trigger
					Fixed a bug where Akali's R - Perfect Execution dealt damage to all opponents based on the health of the last enemy struck, rather than calculating damage individually for each
					Maokai R - Nature's Grasp's sfx now correctly line up with the ability's duration.
					Fixed a bug where ranged attacks and targeted projectiles would have their VFX appear from the champion's last seen location, if they were not currently in vision
					Deep Sea Nami no longer leaves her spine behind while moving during her recall animation.

		Welcome to Patch 8.16, the one where we buff up a few tanks, and some champions who have been terrorizing the Rift get taken down a peg.
		First, we've noticed that tanks are struggling on the Rift. We don't want to put power into their itemization, so we're taking this opportunity to add some baseline power into their kits. Then, there's a few outliers who need to be kept in check, like Aatrox, Fizz, and Tryndamere.
		Also, we're launching a two patch alpha playtest of Nexus Blitz, a new experimental game mode. It'll launch soon after the patch, so get out there and blitz the enemy Nexus!

	Champions
	
		
			
				
				Aatrox
				E passive healing against non-champions decreased. Charges granted on learning E decreased. R cooldown increased at early ranks.
				
					We've mostly gotten Aatrox's power level to a good place, but we still need to trim a bit of his laning strength to prevent him from being so much of a bully.
				
				E - Umbral Dash
				
					PASSIVE HEALING AGAINST NON-CHAMPIONS 33% ⇒ 15%
				
				
					CHARGES WHEN LEARNED 2 ⇒ 1
				
				R - World Ender
				
					COOLDOWN 140/130/120 seconds ⇒ 160/140/120 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Fizz
				W damage ratio decreased. R damage ratio decreased.
				
					The Fizz buffs last patch overshot a bit, so we're pulling back on some of his newfound damage.
				
				W - Seastone Trident
				
					ACTIVE DAMAGE RATIO 0.6 ability power ⇒ 0.5 ability power
				
				
					ON-HIT DAMAGE RATIO 0.4 ability power ⇒ 0.35 ability power
				
				R - Chum the Waters
				
					GUPPY DAMAGE RATIO 0.9 ability power ⇒ 0.8 ability power
				
				
					CHOMPER DAMAGE RATIO 1.1 ability power ⇒ 1.0 ability power
				
				
					GIGALODON DAMAGE RATIO 1.3 ability power ⇒ 1.2 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Hecarim
				Q base damage increased at later ranks. Q damage ratio increased.
				
					Hecarim is pretty weak currently, but we want to be careful about how we buff him. A bit more extended dps should help him shine in the mid-game without making him into a one-shot monster.
				
				Q - Rampage
				
					BASE DAMAGE 55/90/125/160/195 ⇒ 55/95/135/175/215
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.6 bonus attack damage ⇒ 0.7 bonus attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Orianna
				Base magic resist decreased.
				
					Orianna excels at keeping enemies at range with her ball range and the crowd control it brings. We want to make sure that when her opponents do close the gap, they have a better shot at the kill.
				
				Base Stats
				
					MAGIC RESIST 30 ⇒ 26
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Quinn
				Attack damage growth decreased.
				
					The only thing faster than Valor's movement speed is Quinn's burst, and the two combine to give her opponents little time to respond even if they see her coming.
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH 3 ⇒ 2.4
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rakan
				Health and armor decreased.
				
					High mobility and durability has always been a tricky combination in our game, and Rakan has become a dominant pick on the back of his. We're toning down Rakan’s durability in the early game to make him vulnerable in more matchups.
				Base Stats
				
					HEALTH 510 ⇒ 480
				
				
					ARMOR 36 ⇒ 33
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Taliyah
				Movement speed decreased. W cooldown increased at early ranks. R wall no longer grants vision.
				
					Taliyah's ability to shove and run around the map is putting too much pressure on other lanes. We're also trimming some hidden power from her ultimate.
				
				Base Stats
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 340 ⇒ 335
				
				W - Seismic Shove
				
					COOLDOWN 12 seconds ⇒ 16/15/14/13/12 seconds
				
				R - Weaver's Wall
				
					removedVISION Wall no longer grants vision
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Trundle
				Q base damage decreased at later ranks. Q damage ratio increased at later ranks. Q attack damage sap duration decreased.
				
					Trundle's dueling potential is too high, even if he isn't building damage.
				
				Q - Chomp
				
					BASE DAMAGE 20/40/60/80/100 ⇒ 20/30/40/50/60
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 1.0/1.05/1.1/1.15/1.2 total attack damage ⇒ 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 total attack damage
				
				
					STOLEN ATTACK DAMAGE DURATION 8 seconds ⇒ 5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Tryndamere
				E cooldown increased at later ranks.
				
					This buff has made Tryndamere too sticky, so we're reverting it.
				
				E - Spinning Slash
				
					COOLDOWN 13/11.5/10/8.5/7 seconds ⇒ 13/12/11/10/9 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Wukong
				Q base damage decreased. Q damage ratio decreased.
				
					Wukong's burst damage is too high for a champion who has both a dash and invisibility to reduce the amount of time opponents have to respond.
				
				Q - Crushing Blow
				
					BASE DAMAGE 30/60/90/120/150 ⇒ 10/40/70/100/130
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 total attack damage ⇒ 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zoe
				Passive damage decreased at all ranks. W damage ratio decreased.
				
					Zoe should do less damage when she doesn't land her skillshots.
				
				Passive - More Sparkles!
				
					BASE DAMAGE LEVELS 1-6 12/15/20/25/30/35 ⇒ 10/12/16/20/24/28
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE LEVELS 7-10 48/53/67/73 ⇒ 34/40/46/52
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE LEVELS 11-14 79/86/93/100 ⇒ 60/68/76/84
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE LEVELS 15-18 109/117/126/135 ⇒ 94/104/114/124
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.325 ability power ⇒ 0.2 ability power
				
				W - Spell Thief
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.55 ability power ⇒ 0.4 ability power
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Tanks
	
		
			
				
					Tanks haven't been feeling so hot in recent patches, so we're taking this opportunity to put more durability into their kits.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Amumu
				E passive now scales with bonus armor and magic resist.
				E - Tantrum
				
					newBONUS DAMAGE REDUCTION 3% bonus armor + 3% magic resist
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE REDUCTION 2/4/6/8/10 (unchanged)

				W cooldown decreased at later ranks.
				W - Eclipse
				
					COOLDOWN 14 seconds ⇒ 14/13/12/11/10 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Nautilus
				W base shield decreased slightly early, increased at later ranks. W maximum health scaling decreased at later ranks. W duration and cooldown decreased.
				W - Titan's Wrath
				
					BASE SHIELD 65/70/75/80/85 ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100
				
				
					SHIELD SCALING 9/11/13/15/17% maximum health ⇒ 9/10/11/12/13% maximum health

				W bonus resists increased.
				W - Defensive Ball Curl
				
					BONUS ARMOR 50/60/70/80/90% ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100%
				
				
					BONUS MAGIC RESIST 25/30/35/40/45% ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Sion
				W health gain increased.
				W - Soul Furnace
				
					MAXIMUM HEALTH GAIN FROM ENEMIES 3 ⇒ 4
				
				
					MAXIMUM HEALTH GAIN FROM LARGE ENEMIES 10 ⇒ 15
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Tahm Kench
				Q slow duration and cooldown decreased. W duration decreased at later ranks. W cooldown significantly increased. W mana cost decreased. W cooldown now halved on enemy Devour.
				Q - Tongue Lash
				
					SLOW DURATION 2 seconds ⇒ 1.5 seconds
				
				
					COOLDOWN 6 seconds ⇒ 5 seconds
				
				W - Devour/Regurgitate
				
					DEVOUR DURATION 4/4.5/5/5.5/6 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
				
				
					ENEMY CHAMPION DURATION Half ally duration (unchanged)
				
				
					COOLDOWN 14/13/12/11/10 seconds ⇒ 28/25/22/19/16 seconds
				
				
					newYUMMY Cooldown is halved on enemy cast
				
				
					COST 90 mana ⇒ 60 mana
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Runes
	
		
			
				Burst Runes
				
					The high burst damage present in the rune systems has overall warped lethality and game pacing, so we're pulling damage out of the worst offenders.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Summon Aery
				Base damage decreased at early levels. Base shielding increased at early levels.
				
					BASE DAMAGE 15-40 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 10-40 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					BASE SHIELDING 30-80 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 35-80 (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Electrocute
				Base damage decreased. Damage ratio decreased.
				
					BASE DAMAGE 50-220 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 30-180 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO (AD) 0.5 bonus attack damage ⇒ 0.4 bonus attack damage
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO (AP) 0.3 ability power ⇒ 0.25 ability power
				
				
					COOLDOWN 50-25 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 25-20 seconds (at levels 1-18)

					BASE DAMAGE 15-40 ⇒ 8-40
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Sudden Impact
				Lethality and magic penetration decreased.
				
					LETHALITY 10 ⇒ 7
				
				
					MAGIC PENETRATION 8 ⇒ 6
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Scorch
				Base damage decreased. Cooldown decreased.
				
					BASE DAMAGE 20-60 ⇒ 10-30
				
				
					COOLDOWN 20 seconds ⇒ 10 seconds
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Summoner Spells
	
		
			
				Heal
				Cooldown decreased.
				
					In patch 8.6, Heal was crowding out other options in mid lane, so we lengthened its cooldown. This pushed both marksmen and mid laners onto teleport (which has had a much more notable impact on the meta), so we're reverting the Heal nerf.
				
				
					COOLDOWN 270 seconds ⇒ 240 seconds

  Welcome to patch 8.15. As mentioned in previous patches, after the significant changes in midseason, we're mostly focusing on balancing outliers. As a result, this is a pretty small patch.To start, we're taking a look at marksmen. They're
    still feeling some pain from their midseason changes (especially in mid-game when they can't yet afford multiple items), so we're decreasing the cost of their items to let them hit their power spike more quickly and decreasing their overall stats
    slightly to compensate.Akali's rework also hits the Rift this patch, so be sure to check out her new abilities.GLHF,

        Fiddlesticks
        E cost increased at early ranks. E base damage decreased.
        Fiddlesticks ability to poke (particularly as a support in bot lane) is currently too high.

        Fizz
        W active base damage increased. W active and on-hit damage ratios increased. R ability power ratios increased, increased less for larger sharks.
        The recent changes to Fizz have left him weaker on damage than intended.

        Irelia
        Attack damage increased. Health increased. Passive damage increased. Q range, base damage, and damage ratio decreased. E range and base damage decreased. R range decreased.
        As a continuation of our changes to Irelia, we're shifting more of her power out of her abilities and into her basic attacks.

        Kindred
        W attack speed scaling (for Wolf) decreased. R cooldown increased.
        Recent bugfixes gave Kindred far more of a bump than expected, and as a result they have emerged as a dominant jungler. Pulling back some power and aligning their ultimate cooldown with other similarly game-changing ultimates.

        Lee Sin
        Q base damage decreased. Q damage ratio increased. No longer deals damage based on target's missing health damage. Now scales amplified damage based on target's missing health.
        Lee Sin is an aggressive, snowball-oriented champion and we want to make sure he is appropriately rewarded when he does get ahead.


        Q - Sonic Wave / Resonating Strike

        Morgana
        Base mana regen decreased. Black Shield cost increased.
        In her other roles, Morgana's ability to spam spells is gated by the harsh mana scaling on her W, but as a support (where she maxes W last), she has too much lane consistency.

        Quinn
        Armor decreased. Passive damage decreased.
        Quinn's lane strength has started to become a bit of an issue. As a ranged champion, when she does get hard-engaged on she shouldn't be quite so hard to kill.

        We feel like Thresh could use a bit more power, specifically in his early game all-in potential and his late-game playmaking options.

        Support Items
        Cost of starting support items increased.
        The current cost of support items lets support players mitigate a pretty high amount of poke through potions, which makes trading feel more ineffective than we'd like.

        Marksman Itemization
        Our goal of giving marksmen a later spike was hit a little bit too hard, and it's left marksmen feeling underwhelming in the mid-game (and thus often unable to reach their late-game power). We're decreasing the cost of some marksman items so they
          spike earlier, but cutting some of their late-game power so they don't take over the game when they get there.

        In 8.12, we made some changes to Essence Reaver that were intended to make the item more accessible, but it looks like those changes also slightly weakened the item overall. As a result, we're adding some power back.

        Monster Hunter restriction now applies if the champion has the highest minion kill score, not the most gold.
        The previous Monster Hunter had the effect of inhibiting the snowball of a jungle who got ahead with kills, not just a champion who was duo-farming the jungle. We're changing the mechanic to only restrict champions who have the highest minion
          score, not the highest gold.

        Perfect Timing
        Time of activation pushed to later in the game.
        In patch 8.4, we pushed the activation time of Stopwatch to 10 minutes because its prevalence in professional play was delaying or inhibiting early action. In 8.10 we tried a lower value (8 minutes), but we've begun observing the same impact on
          pro play, so we're reverting those changes.

		Welcome to patch 8.14. Over the last few patches, the game has seen some pretty hefty changes to the jungle, mid lane, marksmen, and Aatrox. For the next few patches, we'll be dialing it back and doing some smaller-scope changes, mostly balance tweaks.
		First, you'll notice two new section as of last patch: simple buffs and simple nerfs. For the most part, that's for self-explanatory changes designed at making a champion stronger or weaker but not really altering their playstyle all that meaningfully.
		We're also following up on the Aatrox rework, looking to reduce some of his overbearing lane presence and give him more to do in late-game teamfights. Finally, we're taking a small dive into two of our AP assassins (Fizz and Ahri) to make their gameplay a bit more intuitive and satisfying.
		GLHF!

				Aatrox
				Base health decreased. Q base damage decreased. E recharge rate decreased early, increased later. R bonus attack damage increased. Q timer freezes while reviving.
				
					Now that Aatrox players have gotten some games under their belt and mastered his pretty unique spells, it turns out he's pretty strong, especially in lane. We're pulling some of his early game power in exchange for some more late-game consistency.

				Fizz
				W no longer deals bonus damage against primed targets. W base damage increased. W now grants on-hit damage if empowered attack does not kill its target.
				
					The mark-priming mechanic on Fizz's W was unsatisfying, asking players to hold one of their damage tools until later. As an assassin, his role is to lay down damage quickly and get out, which made that wait feel particularly awkward. We're removing the priming mechanic, and bringing back an on-hit buff on the active, but keeping the cooldown reset on kills. The new W still does damage over a longer period of time, but more of that damage is front-loaded so Fizz players can more quickly make like a trident and stab.
				
				updatedW - Seastone Trident
				Fizz's next basic attack deals bonus damage. If it kills a unit, W's cooldown and mana cost are partially refunded. If it doesn't, Fizz's subsequent basic attacks are empowered for 5 seconds.

				Karma
				Base mana regen increased; growth decreased. Base armor increased; Q splash radius increased. Empowered detonation damage decreased at early ranks.
				
					Support Karma is struggling hard at most skill levels, but at this point a straight buff might push her too high up in organized play. We're upping her baseline spellcasting and durability, but pulling back some of her waveclear to keep her from becoming overbearing at the highest levels of play.

				Jungle Items
				If you have the most individual total gold on your team, lane minions kills grant less gold.
				
					Jungle funneling tends to be a very passive and unengaging strategy, largely rooted in avoiding conflict. This is subverting a lot of normal laning patterns, so we're looking to significantly nerf the strategy. We'll be pursuing cleaner system solutions to the problem in preseason, but for now we're just trying to decrease the viability of funneling.
				
				Hunter's Machete/Hunter's Talisman
				
					newMONSTER HUNTER If you have the most individual total gold on your team, lane minions kills will grant 10 less gold. This penalty is removed upon completion of an Enchantment on a Skirmisher's Sabre or Stalker's Blade.

	Summoner Spells
	
		
			
				
				 Teleport
				Cooldown increased.
				
					Teleport has emerged as a dominant summoner spell in most lanes. This is particularly problematic bot lane, where it's often taken on champions who simply wish to avoid conflict in the laning phase and scale into the late game. For now, we're increasing the cooldown to give combat summoners a longer window in which to punish Teleport users.

				Bonus attack damage decreased.
				
					Conqueror has been crowding out other keystone options for fighters, as well as room for non-fighter champions in top lane. Reducing some of its laning strength should give other keystones (and champions) more ability to fight back.

				Zombie Wards no longer spawn from friendly wards which time out. Damaging a champion after destroying a ward inflicts bonus damage.

	Cursor Update
	
		
			
					
				
				(Left to right, top row: Default Cursor, Ally Hover, Enemy Hover, Enemy Hover - Colorblind)(Left to right, bottom row: Target, Ward Bush + Target Ally, Attack Move + Target Enemy)
				
					After nine and a half years, we’re updating the in-game cursor! It’s got all the same functionality as the bronze gauntlet we've worn for years but with a bunch of improvements.
				
				
					NEW All cursor states have been updated (see above for some of the most common)
				
				
					SHAPE Cleaner and simpler, so it's easier to track as it moves across your screen
				
				
					COLORS Adjusted across all states prevent blending in with the map or with particles in chaotic team fights
				
				
					SCALABLE Can now be scaled up and down in the Options > Interface menu. Great for 4K resolutions!
				
				
					NOSTALGIA You can still switch back to the old cursor via a toggle in the Options > Interface menu

	Champ Select
	
		
			
				Failing to ban a champion no longer kicks you from champ select. This change went live during 8.13.
				
					It’s a bit harsh to break up a champ select lobby on a missed ban selection, so instead, failing to ban a champion will default to “No Ban” and champ select will keep on truckin’. Failing to select a champion for yourself will still incur a dodge.

		Welcome to patch 8.13, where we clean up a lot of the outliers left as a result of the large changes over the past few patches.
		First, we're putting some strength back into the kits of a number of crit marksmen, who have been facing stiff competition in bot lane. We're aiming to hold onto some of that lane diversity, but we want to make sure that enough marksmen (especially the \"attack you a lot in a row and crit a ton\" type) feel solid.
		Since we've got some more games in the rearview mirror since Irelia's rework and Pyke's release, we're tweaking both of those champions to push their playstyles away from some of the free burst they have.
		Finally, Aatrox hAas gotten Aa rework, so look out for the revamped Darkin Blade on Summoner's Rift!

				7/3/2018 Balance Update
				
					8.13 is a longer patch than normal, so we're releasing a bunch of small balance changes to tide us over until 8.14 in a few weeks. Most of the changes are strict buffs to marksmen, but we're also knocking down two dominant picks in Nocturne and Taliyah.

			Base health increased. Q damage increased. E healing increased. E distance increased. E now resets attack timer. R cooldown decreased at early ranks.

				Irelia
				Passive on-hit damage decreased. Passive attack speed increased. W damage decreased at lower stacks.
				
					Irelia has fallen into a burstier pattern than intended, which doesn't leave opponents much time to react. We're pushing some of her damage into her base attacks, stacking her passive, and charging her W, so she unloads her full damage a bit more slowly.
				
				Passive - Ionian Fervor

				Kindred
				W now correctly scales with items. W no longer reduces monster attack speed. Kindred once again gains stacks of Hunter's Vigor from moving and attacking.
				
					There once was a duo named Kindred
					Whose jungle strength Scuttle Crab hind'red
					Now Wolf's attacks scale
					Lamb's healthy and hale

				Lucian
				Attack damage growth decreased. R damage amplification to minions decreased.
				
					Lucian is pretty much the premiere bot laner right now: Some of his core items got cheaper and most of his competition got weaker. Plus with Essence Reaver, his late game is stronger, making him one of the best marksmen both in lane and in late game. We're choosing to prioritize keeping that lane strength.

				Pyke
				Health growth decreased. Armor and magic resist growth increased. E and R base damage decreased at later ranks. E and R damage ratio increased.
				
					Pyke has seen a lot of success opting into tank builds and mixed success with more damage builds. We're looking to encourage his more aggressive, less safe build paths by rewarding him more for building damage.
				
				Base stats
				
					HEALTH GROWTH 110 ⇒ 100
				
				
					ARMOR GROWTH 4 ⇒ 5
				
				
					MAGIC RESIST GROWTH 1.25 ⇒ 2

				Hail of Blades
				Out of combat cooldown decreased. Maximum time between attacks increased.

	Early Game Snowball
	
		
			
				
					We've been making changes to the game all season to encourage early action, and we're happy with the increased interaction it's driven. Now that players are more likely to fight, it's gotten far more likely that the game snowballs out of control too early. As a result, we're looking to dial back on how easy it is to get rolling in the first place.
					Specifically, we think that the laning phase should determine the tempo of the rest of the game (whether one team is on their back foot or pushing to take more advantages), but rarely should the laning phase determine the result of the game.
					This patch, we're looking to make it a bit harder to build a large lead in the laning phase, especially early on.
				
				Death Timers
				Death timers decreased at early ranks.
				
					The first place we're starting with is death timers. Getting a kill is one of the high moments of the laning phase. You've asserted your dominance in lane, picked up some gold, and earned a moment to take a breather or pressure elsewhere on the map.
					However, it's got one more effect that’s probably a bit too strong: It takes the victim off the map. While you're dead, you miss out on a ton of experience and gold, meaning that not only has your opponent gotten ahead, but you’ve fallen further behind. We're reducing death timers early on so that players can get back into the action more quickly.
				
				
					DEATH TIMERS LEVELS 1-6 10-22.5 seconds (at levels 1-6) ⇒ 6-16 seconds (at levels 1-6)
				
				
					DEATH TIMERS LEVEL 7 25 seconds ⇒ 21 seconds
				
				
					DEATH TIMERS LEVEL 8+ unchanged
				
				Bounties
				Bounties now start at two kills. Bounty gold increased at all levels of kills.
				
					A bounty is a reward to a team who takes down a champion who has been pulling ahead. Essentially, it's the way we make it worthwhile to keep fighting even while you're down. Currently, those bounties often don't kick in until it's too late for the laning phase: Fighting from three kills down is pretty terrifying. We're introducing a level 2 bounty—and also increasing bounty gold overall—to make fighting from behind feel more rewarding. Still the same risk (dying again), but a much better reward.
				
				
					new2-KILL BOUNTY 150 gold
				
				
					3-6 KILLS 200-325 gold (at 3-6 kills) ⇒ 300-500 gold (at 3-6 kills)
				
				
					LEVEL 6+ 25 gold per additional kill ⇒ 50 gold per additional kill
				
				Outer Turret Gold
				Global gold reward decreased.
				When it comes down to it, we want the laning phase to determine which lanes are ahead or behind, not which team is ahead or behind. The large global outer turret gold reward is a little too tilted towards the latter, so we're reducing that reward.
				
					GOLD REWARD 100 gold per player per turret ⇒ 50 gold per player per turret

				Inappropriate name detection buffed.
				
					The detection for, um, unsavory summoner names is getting a big buff. So your reports on names should net you some of that feel good Reporter Feedback. If your name gets rekt, you'll be forced to choose a new one, but there are no additional penalties or impacts to your Honor level.

  In recent history, we've seen mage changes in 8.9, jungle shifts in 8.10, and most recently marksman adjustments in 8.11. 8.12 ends this \"midseason\" timeframe—so named because we're in the middle of the season but no single patch was kingmade as a \"Midseason\"
    event. A few final systems changes are in this patch, but our focus has otherwise already shifted to followup. The plan between now and preseason is mainly to smooth out the rough edges and balance issues, meaning until preseason comes around, patches
    will be less disruptive than what you've seen over the past few months.Back to 8.12! We're tuning down the duration of allied shield abilities and the strength of the Forbidden Idol item line with the goal of making shields fairer for
    enemies to play against. If you were watching PBE this patch, you also saw some item changes to help fighters carry late-game teamfights. Fighters have gotten stronger over the past few patches thanks to what's changed around them, and the
    landscape is still rapidly shifting. We're holding off on most of these changes until the dust clears, lest we power up a class that no longer needs the help.GLHF,

  Mid-Patch Updates

  
    
      6/18/2018 Balance Update

      We'll be looking to make individual marksman changes in the coming patches, but we don't want to risk overbuffing them alongside item changes. To start, we're adding power to some core crit items before looking at individual champions too heavily.

      Infinity Edge
      TOTAL COST
        3700 gold
        ⇒
        3600 gold

        ⇒
        0.75 seconds
      


      Essence Reaver
      Essence Reaver is performing pretty well on users who have some way to \"cheat\" extra basic attacks (Lucian's passive or Renekton's W, or attack resets), and thus get far more ability refreshes. We want to open Essence Reaver up to a few more champions
        without buffing it on the core champions, and that means giving more attack speed so that champions without bonus attacks in their kit can get more bang for their buck.

      BUFF DURATION

  Champions
    
      
        
        Elise
        Human and Spider form movement speed increased. Human W damage increased.
        We've been watching Elise for a while, but wanted to see how she'd do with the Runic Echoes rework in 8.10 and subsequent buffs in 8.11. She's pretty far below the average Echoes jungler, so the runway's clear for direct buffs.

        Base Stats
        HUMAN FORM MOVEMENT SPEED
          325
          ⇒

          ⇒
          60/105/150/195/240
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Ezreal
        Armor decreased.
        Ez is still running rampant after the scaling nerfs we shipped partway through last patch, so we're making it easier to boot him out of lane without letting him hit his item cost thresholds. In particular, this may leave him stuck on Tear of the
          Goddess (potentially not even that) without damage items for longer.
        Base Stats

        These went live last patch.
        ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH
          3.11
          ⇒
          2.5
        
        PASSIVE - RISING SPELL FORCE ATTACK SPEED

        Kindred
        Attack speed growth increased. Q attack speed increased. E damage increased.
        Kindred's recently taken losses from both the Rift Scuttler changes and the Zeal item nerfs. We're building on last patch's buffs (focused on adjusting Kindred's early marks to account for the Scuttler changes) with a heavier power-up this time
          around.
        

        Base Stats

        Lee Sin
        W cooldown decreased. E damage increased.
        Last patch's buffs didn't go far enough in bringing Lee back up from the Warding Totem changes, so we're giving him a few more buffs.

        W - Safeguard / Iron Will
        COOLDOWN
          14 seconds
          ⇒
          12 seconds

        Poppy
        Passive cooldown decreased late. Q cooldown decreased; ratio increased.
        Giving Poppy a bit more oomph throughout the game, particularly with aggressive builds.

        Rumble
        W shield increased. R damage increased.
        We're leaning into Rumble's lane bully strengths by making fights more favorable for him and letting him carry that lead more convincingly if he can secure it.

        W - Scrap Shield
        BASE SHIELD

        Sejuani
        Icebreaker deals less damage vs monsters but no longer has a cooldown against them. More units can be frozen. W costs less, now has AP ratios. E damage and ratio increased.
        Sejuani's been bristling for a buff since her nerfs earlier in the season, so we’re making her early clear healthier and more engaging. We’re also giving her some itemization flexibility by letting her feel good about pickups with AP in their
          stat lines.

        Taliyah
        Q rocks beyond the first deal slightly less damage to champions.
        When we shipped 8.11, Taliyah landed in a weak spot. We gave her a bunch of buffs partway through the patch, which overcompensated and pushed her too high. So we're reining in one of those mid-patch buffs to a more workable middle ground.

        Yorick
        Q cooldown decreased late. Mist Walkers and the Maiden now update their stats when Yorick's stats change.
        With no bonus AD ratios in his kit, the Sterak's shift from granting base AD to bonus AD weakens Yorick's Trinity Force damage without increasing the impact of his abilities. (Other Sterak's/Trinity Force champions in this bonus-ratio-less position
          are either pretty far ahead of Yorick power-wise or have other builds to lean on.) Since this build has historically been Yorick's only good offensive choice, we're giving him some buffs to offset a nerf he has no way of sidestepping.

  Allied Shield Abilities & Items
    
      
        This pass comes in two parts: abilities that shield allies (\"gifted shields\") and items that increase shield strength. On the ability front, we're tightening up the timing requirements of gifted shields. Enemies should be able to play around shields
          in some scenarios by baiting them out and waiting for them to fall off, rather than always having to try to brute-force their way through. Shortening the duration of shields makes that counterplay more realistic in more cases and makes proper
          timing of shield abilities a more important skill for enchanters to master.On the item front, the Forbidden Idol line has been incredibly stat-efficient since the introduction of heal/shield power back in Season 6. This was meant
          to offset supports' historical lack of income at the time, but the economy's changed in the two years since. Simple stat nerfs to these items will bring them to a more reasonable spot (particularly when stacked with each other in the late game)
          and hopefully give enchanters a little more freedom in the items they choose to pick up, since \"not an Idol item\" is now a less punishing tradeoff.

        Unlike other gifted shields, Eye of the Storm comes with bonus AD that enemies want to knock off as quickly as possible. If we went with a duration reduction, waiting the shield out still wouldn't make sense as a form of counterplay since you'd
          just be letting Janna's carry hold onto free stats. Nuking the shield would end up feeling worse too, since there'd be much less buff duration to deny. By contrast, a decaying shield makes damage on the shield more effective while keeping the
          payoff for blowing it up satisfying.

        Shield duration decreased.
        Lulu's E has a visual indicator to let everyone know who Pix is attached to (...it's Pix). So we're able to reduce Help, Pix!'s shield duration without reducing the window Lulu has to fire a Glitterlance from her ally's location.

        Athene's Unholy Grail
        More damage is converted to healing charges.
        This change is in part an invisible Chalice of Harmony buff. With Forbidden Idol brought in line, Chalice stands a chance at making it into enchanter laning builds. Ensuring Athene's is a worthy upgrade (particularly in a world with less heal/shield
          power) makes that a more realistic possibility.

        Banner of Command
        Banner of Command was intended as a strategic-niche item that pushes a lane autonomously, forcing enemies to deal with the threat while Banner's owner is making plays elsewhere on the map. However, it’s only ever lived in two states: rarely purchased
          even in the situations it was meant for, or meta-warping. We’re removing Banner from the shop and taking a step back to evaluate if this item niche is both engaging and fun enough to work in League. Even if that answer is \"yes,\" Banner would
          need some serious work to make a return, so this is goodbye for the foreseeable future.
      
    
  
  
    
      
        
        Sterak's Gage
        Passive grants bonus attack damage instead of base attack damage.
        Sterak's Gage was designed as a juggernaut item, but has become a Trinity Force combo piece due to granting additional base attack damage rather than bonus attack damage. For most current users (see Yorick above for notes on exceptions),
          swapping Sterak's to grant bonus AD is some degree of sidegrade. They'll gain damage through the bonus AD ratios in their abilities rather than Spellblade procs. On the other hand, non-Trinity Force juggernauts (and divers) can make better          use of Sterak's than before.

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to 8.11, part of our continuing series of role tweaks. 8.9 was mages, 8.10 saw changes to the jungle; this time around we're swinging into bot lane!
		8.11 brings a bunch of changes to marksman items and runes, as well as base stat shifts across the roster. We're opening the door for non-crit builds to shine by adding or reworking new tools for spellslingers and lane bullies alike, and by reining in lane sustain to make early aggression a more effective path to victory. Many of these options should be pretty appealing to AD fighters and assassins as well, so make sure to check the changes out regardless of your lane preference.
		We've also got some follow-up tuning to last patch's work on the jungle. We're seeing teams adjust to Rift Scuttler as a contestable objective in the early game, with laners becoming more willing to help their jungler secure the crab. We're slightly lengthening its respawn time so these river fights are a little less frequent, making the regular camps a little bit more rewarding to avoid pushing junglers back in experience across the board. A few of the stand-out scuttle slayers are also taking a few hits so other junglers can compete.
		Of course, none of this matters if you're on Pyke's list. Don't let his support tag fool you—if you turn your back on the Bloodharbor Ripper, you'll find yourself sinking to the bottom of the sea. Or the ranked ladder. Same thing, really.

Patch Update

	
		
			6/1/2018 Balance Update
			Yasuo
			
				The loss of crit chance on IE means if Yasuo wants to utilize his crit-doubling passive, he has to rush a Zeal item—none of which come with AD. We're giving him some early/midgame help so he's better able to make it through the process of building Phantom Dancer, while also letting up on the Q crit damage reduction now that IE no longer multiplies crit damage.
			
			
				BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 60 ⇒ 63
			
			
				Q - STEEL TEMPEST CRIT DAMAGE 150% ⇒ 180% (Tooltip will be updated in 8.12!)
			
			
				BUGFIX The combination of Brawler's Gloves and Infinity Edge now properly grants Yasuo 40% critical strike chance
			
			Kai'Sa
			
				Kai'Sa was one of the strongest marksmen prior to 8.11 and since her Rageblade build avoids this patch's early game power-downs to crit builds, that \"front of the pack\" status has become stand-out dominance. (These changes include a W ratio boost to keep the AP Kai'Sa dream alive.)
			
			
				PLASMA BASE ON-HIT DAMAGE 7-12 at levels 1-16 ⇒ 4-10 at levels 1-16
			
			
				PLASMA PER-STACK DAMAGE 1-9 at levels 1-17 ⇒ 1-5 at levels 1-17
			
			
				PLASMA AP RATIO 0.2/0.25/0.3/0.35/0.4 (for stacks 1-5) ⇒ 0.1/0.125/0.15/0.175/0.2 (for stacks 1-5)
			
			
				W - VOID SEEKER RATIO 0.45 ability power ⇒ 0.6 ability power
			
			Ezreal
			
				Ez is another non-crit marksman who was already prevalent leading up to 8.11 and is now over the line. (In his case, he actually got a direct buff via Blade of the Ruined King.)
			
			
				ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH 3.11 ⇒ 2.5
			
			
				PASSIVE - RISING SPELL FORCE ATTACK SPEED 10/12/14% per stack ⇒ 10% per stack at all levels
			
			Taliyah
			
				Now that Taliyah's damage against minions is down (making wave control less automatic), she has room for more damage against champions.
			
			
				BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 56 ⇒ 58
			
			
				Q - THREADED VOLLEY DAMAGE VS CHAMPIONS 40% for rocks beyond the first ⇒ 60% for rocks beyond the first
			
			
				E - UNRAVELED EARTH DASH DAMAGE 35/45/55/65/75 (+0.2 ability power) ⇒ 50/60/70/80/90 (+0.3 ability power)
			
			Banner of Command
			
				We changed Banner to make the empowered minion less of a shutdown against AP champs, but now it's causing problems for everyone, especially when multiple teammates start stacking it.
			
			
				EMPOWERED MINION DAMAGE REDUCTION 70% ⇒ 40% (Tooltip will be updated in 8.12!)

			5/31/2018 Balance Update
			Pyke
			
				We expect Pyke to have a steep learning curve, so we were conservative with his launch strength to make sure he doesn't grow into an overpowered state in the weeks to come. We overshot on the guardrails, so we're pumping some power into Pyke's laning strength to help him have more consistent games while players learn his kit.
			
			
				BASE HEALTH REGEN 5 health per 5 seconds ⇒ 7 health per 5 seconds
			
			
				BASE MANA 380 ⇒ 415
			
			
				BASE ARMOR 42 ⇒ 45
			
			
				BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 60 ⇒ 62

				Anivia
				Q cooldown decreased at early ranks. Q damage ratio increased.
				
					Patch 8.9's mana changes hit Anivia harder than most mages, so we're looking to give her some power back. Rather than return her previous level of waveclear, we're looking to up her potential in fights.
				
				Q - Flash Frost
				
					COOLDOWN 12/11/10/9/8 seconds ⇒ 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 seconds
				
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.4 ability power ⇒ 0.45 ability power (reminder: this applies on both passthrough and detonation)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Graves
				Base attack damage decreased. R cooldown decreased at early ranks.
				
					The new emphasis on early jungle scrapping is pretty much Graves' happy place, and it's left other champions six feet under. Dialing back his early dueling and putting a longer window on his full combo should slow the snowball a bit.
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 69 ⇒ 66
				
				R - Collateral Damage
				
					COOLDOWN 110/85/60 seconds ⇒ 120/90/60 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kha'Zix
				R cooldown decreased at later ranks, but stealth duration decreased. Evolved R grants additional casts and stealth duration; no longer grants stealth or movement speed in brush.
				
					One thing every assassin needs is a way to dance in and out of a fight and safely put down damage. For Kha'Zix, that's the stealth from Void Assault . The brush stealth on his evolved R is currently giving far too much of a different strength, though: the ability to sneak around the map relatively undetected. We're removing that evolution bonus in favor of giving Kha'Zix more R casts—and longer stealth—when he's upgraded his ultimate.
				
				R - Void Assault
				
					COOLDOWN 100/90/80 seconds ⇒ 100/85/70 seconds
				
				
					STEALTH DURATION 1.5 seconds ⇒ 1.25 seconds
				
				
					EVOLVED STEALTH DURATION 1.5 seconds ⇒ 2 seconds
				
				
					EVOLVED CASTS 2 within 10 seconds ⇒ 3 within 10 seconds
				
				
					removedBRUSH CHECK No longer passively grants stealth or movement speed when entering brush
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kindred
				Mark respawn time decreased. First mark spawns earlier. Rift Scuttle assists now correctly collect marks.
				
					The increased importance of Scuttle Crab has made it harder for Kindred to gather marks.
				
				Passive - Mark of the Kindred
				
					MARK RESPAWN TIME 50 seconds ⇒ 40 seconds
				
				
					FIRST MARK SPAWN 2:20 ⇒ 2:05
				
				
					BUGFIX Assists on Rift Scuttler now appropriately collect marks
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				LeBlanc
				LeBlanc can now queue up casts of W and RW (in either order).
				W - Distortion
				
					ONE-TWO LeBlanc can now queue up W - Distortion and R - Mimic'd Distortion
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Lee Sin
				Energy restore on passive increased. Q, W, and E now apply cooldown reduction for the duration of their reactivation time.
				
					Recent changes to Warding Trinket have left Lee Sin with fewer playmaking opportunities. Making sure he benefits fully from cooldown reduction should give him more to do with his baseline kit, and we also want to make sure he has more access to the energy needed to do so.
				
				Passive - Flurry
				
					ENERGY RESTORED ON FIRST HIT 20/25/30 ⇒ 20/30/40
				
				
					ENERGY RESTORED ON SECOND HIT 10/12.5/15 ⇒ 10/15/20
				
				Q - Sonic Wave/Resonating Strike
				
					newHOW MUCH LONGER Timer displays on icon, showing second cast availability
				
				
					newKEEP COUNTING Cooldown reduction now also applies for the duration of the reactivation time
				
				W - Safeguard/Iron Will

					newKEEP COUNTING Cooldown reduction now also applies for the duration of the reactivation time
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rakan
				Q base heal decreased. E base shield decreased
				
					For a support with so much hard engage, the sustain Rakan brings to lane is a bit overbearing.
				
				Q - Gleaming Quill
				
					BASE HEAL 22.5-150 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 18-120 (at levels 1-18)
				
				E - Battle Dance
				
					BASE SHIELD 50/75/100/125/150 ⇒ 40/65/90/115/140
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Taliyah
				You're probably just going to want to read this one.
				
					Taliyah has a lot of strengths that are great in pro play, and just okay elsewhere. A lot of that comes from Q's waveclear, so the bulk of our mechanical changes focus on that ability (with tuning elsewhere). Taliyah will have to work harder to shove a wave and roam so that her opposing laner has more room to punish those roams. We're also decreasing the terrain control she brings from her ultimate, as it's bringing too much utility beyond just its roam strength.
				
				Base Stats
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 325 ⇒ 340
				
				
					HEALTH 502 ⇒ 532
				
				Passive - Rock Surfing
				
					MAXIMUM MOVEMENT SPEED 20-40% ⇒ 30-45%
				
				
					COMBAT LOCKOUT 5 seconds ⇒ 2 seconds
				
				Q - Threaded Volley
				
					removedAOE No longer deals area of effect damage

				Collision radius decreased. Base attack speed increased. Passive damage to monsters increased early. R no longer roots Urgot while he is grinding a champion to death.

				Xin Zhao
				Base attack damage growth decreased. E slow decreased.
				
					The scuttle changes increased the value of early fights, and Xin Zhao definitely excels in that world. Having a strong early game isn't the problem, but being able to translate that so easily into a strong mid-game is concerning. We're toning down his offensive scaling and his ability to stick to opponents and force them to fight him so he'll have to work harder for that mid-game edge.

				Marksman Base Stat Adjustments
				
					The dominant strategy in bot lane has, over time, become sustaining through lane phase and scaling up into teamfights. Between health regen and Fleet Footwork, it's pretty hard to put the hurt on marksmen in a way they can't just passively recover from.. This means aggressive bot laners ( whether early game bully marksmen or supports who want to poke or go all-in) feel like they have no home.
					Weakening marksman sustain (health regen here, Fleet Footwork below) means damage will stick on marksmen, making 2v2 fighting a more successful prospect for the stronger bot lane. Shifting some durability from armor into health should also let aggressive marksmen like Draven and Lucian shine a bit harder in the early game.
					Finally, we're nerfing marksman base attack damage by 4 and pushing that damage into their growth stat, with the breakeven point around level 9. Though that might seem counterintuitive with our goals above, it means aggressive non-marksmen (ex. Leona, Brand) won't be chipped down by marksman basic attacks as quickly—giving them more opportunities to secure presence in the lane.

			new
			Stormrazor
			For upfront burst and lots of kiting.
			
				Marksman itemization is pretty focus on marksmen who want to stand still and basic attack. With Stormrazor, we're introducing an item for marksmen with longer pauses between attacks, whether they're kiting or just have long attack cooldowns (looking at you, Jhin).
			
			
				TOTAL COST 3200 gold
			
			
				BUILD PATH B.F. Sword + Pickaxe + Dagger + 725 gold
			
			
				ATTACK DAMAGE 70
			
			
				ATTACK SPEED 30%
			
			
				UNIQUE PASSIVE Storm's Edge: If you haven't attacked in the last 3 seconds (scaling down with attack speed), your next basic attack will critically strike for 160% damage (+1% per 1.5% critical strike chance, max 200%) and grant 10% movement speed for 1.75 seconds
			
		
	

	
		
			
				updated
				Infinity Edge
				Crit? Try more crit.
				
					We're making Infinity Edge into a true scaling item for marksmen, one which amps up the power of critical strike but isn't itself a critical strike item.
				
				
					ICONIC Icon has been updated!
				
				
					TOTAL COST 3400 gold ⇒ 3700 gold
				
				
					BUILD PATH B.F. Sword + Pickaxe + Cloak of Agility + 425 gold ⇒ B.F. Sword + B.F. Sword + 1100 gold

					TOTAL COST 4400 gold ⇒ 4700 gold (1000 gold upgrade cost unchanged)
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 100 ⇒ 110 (+30 upgrade benefit unchanged)
				
				
					EVERYTHING ELSE Go read Infinity Edge above.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Essence Reaver
				The ultimate power spike.
				
					Essence Reaver was intended to be the alternative late-game scaling item for marksmen who care more about spell casts. However, it turned out that once you had Essence Reaver, you also wanted Infinity Edge, and at that point, you also want a Zeal item, and at that point you might as well build up to 100% crit. The overall effect was a core build of 4 items that didn't allow spellslinger marksmen much choice at all.
					We're reshaping Essence Reaver around a new power spike, allowing spellcasting marksmen to double down on their spell-slinging fantasy and unleash their spells in a rapid barrage.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 3400 gold ⇒ 3200 gold
				
				
					BUILD PATH B.F. Sword + Caulfield's Warhammer + Cloak of Agility + 200 gold ⇒ B.F. Sword + Caulfield's Warhammer + Sapphire Crystal + 450 gold
				
				
					removedCRITICAL STRIKE CHANCE 20%
				
				
					removedUNIQUE PASSIVE Critical strikes restore 3% of your maximum mana
				
				
					newUNIQUE PASSIVE Basic attacks restore 1% of missing mana
				
				
					newUNIQUE PASSIVE After you cast your ultimate, your next basic attack within 10 seconds grants Essence Flare for 8 seconds, granting 30% attack speed and causing basic attacks to refund 20% of your remaining non-ultimate cooldowns (30 second cooldown)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Last Whisper
				Bonus armor penetration shifted to total armor penetration (and decreased).
				
					The problem with an armor penetration item that only feels good against armor stackers is that most champs don't feel good about getting it early to ensure their damage stays relevant as enemies build armor (they want to be killing squishy targets instead). But once tanks really armor up, damage dealers feel bad if they didn't purchase Last Whisper earlier. We're moving Last Whisper into a middle ground so it'll still scale against tanks but feel like less of a dead-end against other squishies.
				
				
					ARMOR PENETRATION 35% target's bonus armor ⇒ 10% target's total armor
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Lord Dominik's Regards
				Attack damage decreased. Bonus armor penetration shifted to total armor penetration. Bonus damage against higher-health targets removed.
				
					Total armor penetration is stronger than bonus, meaning LDR scales better with itself. To to keep the focus on the armor penetration rather than raw damage output, we're trimming some attack damage and pushing the price point higher.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2600 gold ⇒ 2800 gold
				
				
					BUILD PATH Pickaxe + Last Whisper + 625 gold
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 50 ⇒ 40
				
				
					removedGIANT SLAYER Grants 0-20% (based on health difference) bonus physical damage against enemy champions with greater maximum health than you.
				
				
					ARMOR PENETRATION 35% bonus armor penetration ⇒ 35% total armor penetration
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				removed
				Giant Slayer
				
					Lord Dominik's was the only item that used this, so we're retiring it.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Mortal Reminder
				Attack damage decreased. Bonus armor penetration shifted to total armor penetration.
				
					Total armor penetration is stronger than bonus, meaning Mortal Reminder scales better with itself. To keep the focus on the armor penetration rather than raw damage output, we're trimming some attack damage and pushing the price point higher.
				
				
					COST 2600 gold ⇒ 2800 gold
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE 50 ⇒ 40
				
				
					ARMOR PENETRATION 35% bonus armor penetration ⇒ 25% total armor penetration
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Critical Strike Items
				Average cost of critical strike increased.
				
					With Infinity Edge amplifying critical strike significantly, we're pushing its price point up.
				
				Brawler's Gloves
				
					TOTAL COST 400 gold ⇒ 600 gold
				
				
					newONLY TWO HANDS Brawler's Gloves' critical strike chance is now unique
				
				Cloak of Agility
				
					The Brawler's Gloves changes pushed these two items too close together. A spiky glove feels more crit-like than a poncho, so we're retiring Cloak of Agility.
				
				Zeal
				
					TOTAL COST 1200 gold ⇒ 1300 gold
				
				
					CRITICAL STRIKE CHANCE 20% ⇒ 15%
				
				Rapid Firecannon
				
					TOTAL COST 2600 gold ⇒ 2900 gold

				Lifesteal Items
				Gold cost decreased
				
					Overall, the cost of marksman builds are up slightly, so we feel safe making lifesteal items cheaper.
				
				Blade of the Ruined King
				
					TOTAL COST 3400 gold ⇒ 3200 gold
				
				The Bloodthirster
				
					TOTAL COST 3700 gold ⇒ 3500 gold
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Maw of Malmortius
				Magic resist increased. Base shield value increased. Shield no longer scales with bonus magic resist.
				
					Most champions who like Maw of Malmortius aren't looking to stack resistances, so we're tweaking its shield value to not scale with future magic resist accordingly.
				
				
					MAGIC RESIST 45 ⇒ 50
				
				
					SHIELD VALUE 300 + 100% of bonus magic resist ⇒ 350
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Guardian Angel
				Cost increased. Armor increased.
				
					We wanted to allow marksmen who face heavy physical damage to get a Chain Vest (rather than just Cloth Armor), knowing they'd eventually build it into something. Guardian Angel was a natural choice, even if it required a higher price point.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2400 gold ⇒ 2800 gold
				
				
					BUILD PATH B.F. Sword + Cloth Armor + Stopwatch + 200 gold ⇒ B.F. Sword + Chain Vest + Stopwatch + 100 gold
				
				
					ARMOR 30 ⇒ 40
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Banner of Command
				Enhanced minions are highly resistant to magic and physical damage rather than entirely immune to magic damage only.
				
					Banner of Command has emerged as an item that can effectively pin a mid laner at their wave. With how much gameplay revolves around wave control and roaming, Banner of Command does too much to shut that play down entirely..
				
				
					removedCOOLDOWN REDUCTION 10%
				
				
					removedMAGIC IMMUNITY No longer grants the affected minion 100% immunity to magic damage
				
				
					newDAMAGE REDUCTION Now grants the affected minion 70% damage reduction from champions

					updatedS-BRUCE-D UP Tooltip rewritten to more accurately reflect Banner's effects
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Shurelya's Reverie
				Movement speed decreased. Cost increased. Base mana regen added. Active cooldown increased.
				
					Shurelya's Reverie has emerged as too reliable a rush on certain champions who want it for selfish reasons (rather than as a supportive, team-oriented purchase) Singed and Vladimir among them. We're shifting the stat profile slightly to make it more attractive to supportive champions and slightly less compelling as a selfish buy.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2100 gold ⇒ 2250 gold
				
				
					BUILD PATH Kindlegem + Aether Wisp + 450 gold ⇒ Kindlegem + Aether Wisp + Faerie Charm + 475 gold
				
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 8% ⇒ 5%
				
				
					BASE MANA REGEN 0% ⇒ 100%
				
				
					ACTIVE COOLDOWN 60 seconds ⇒ 90 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Enchantment: Runic Echoes
				Now builds out of Fiendish Codex rather than Lost Chapter. Ability power increased.
				
					Lost Chapter is too expensive for a first component on junglers. Shifting Runic Echoes to build out of Fiendish Codex will give mage junglers an earlier power spike.
				
				
					BUILD PATH Lost Chapter + 325 gold ⇒ Fiendish Codex + Mana Crystal + 375 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2625 gold (unchanged)
				
				
					ABILITY POWER 60 ⇒ 80

	Runes
	
		
			
				Fleet Footwork nerfs, a new Domination keystone, and two new minor runes!
				
					
						Precision
					Fleet Footwork
						
						
							For more context, view the Marksman Stat Adjustment section. TL;DR, marksmen have access to a ton of sustain in the laning phase, which makes the choice between early and late game too tilted towards late game, and decreases the overall impact of laning decisions (like poke/bullying). Weakening the heal ranged champions get from Fleet Footwork should go a long way towards making trades feel more meaningful.
						
						
							HASTE 30% ⇒ 20%
						
						
							removedCRIT HEAL No longer gives additional healing from critical strikes
						
						
							PERCENT HEAL ON MINIONS 60/30% (melee/ranged) ⇒ 100/20% (melee/ranged)
						
						
							HEAL ABILITY POWER RATIO 0.4 ability power ⇒ 0.5 ability power
						
					
						Domination
					NewHail of Blades
						
							One of the goals of runes is to give champions options about what tree they go into based on how they want to play. Domination is a tree about burst, which should make it appealing to some of the burstier marksmen, but there is no real keystone for them. Hail of Blades should help spell-based marksmen who want to lay down a swift chunk have a keystone to promote that playstyle.
						
						
							HAIL OF BLADES Gain 50-100% (at levels 1-18) attack speed for the first three attacks made against enemy champions.
						
						
							NOW NOT LATER If more than 1.5 seconds elapses between attacks this effect will end
						
						
							CANT STOP WONT STOP Hail of Blades allows you to temporarily exceed the attack speed limit
						
						
							COOLDOWN 5 seconds out of combat
						
						newUltimate Hunter
						
							We've been looking into changing Ultimate Hat for awhile. As a rune based around a spike of power (a champion's ultimate), it's always felt like an exciting option for Domination. We're bringing it in line with the Hunter paradigm and have created a replacement for Ultimate Hat below: Nimbus Cloak.
						
						
							ULTIMATE HUNTER Your ultimate gains 5% reduced cooldown, plus an additional 2% per Bounty Hunter stack
						
						
							BOUNTY HUNTER Earn a Bounty Hunter stack the first time you get a takedown on each enemy champion
						
					
						Sorcery
					newNimbus Cloak
						
							Battle mages should feel good about a rune that helps them get (or stay) in a fight when they push their go button.
						
						
							NIMBUS CLOAK Shortly after casting your Ultimate, gain 100 movement speed, decaying over the next 2.5 seconds
						
						
							LIKE THE WIND For the duration of the movement speed increase, you can pass through units
						
						
							COOLDOWN 60 seconds
						
						
							COOLDOWN REDUCTION Unlike other runes, Nimbus Cloak's cooldown is affected by cooldown reduction 
						
						removedUltimate Hat
						
							See context above for Ultimate Hunter.
						
					
						Inspiration
					Minion Dematerializer
						
							Minion Dematerializer is offering too much wave control too early in the game.
						
						
							INITIAL DELAY 155 seconds ⇒ 240 seconds

	Turrets
	
		
			
				Turret Durability
				Inhibitor and Nexus Turret health decreased. Inhibitor Turret health regen increased. Nexus and Inhibitor Turrets can now only regen health up to the next third.
				
					We want to give defenders something to feel good about when they do hold off a push on their base, while also giving sieging teams meaningful milestones other than just \"tower destroyed.\"
				
				
					INHIBITOR TURRET HEALTH 3600 ⇒ 3300
				
				
					NEXUS TURRET HEALTH 3600 ⇒ 2700
				
				
					INHIBITOR TURRET HEALTH REGEN 5 health per 5 seconds ⇒ 15 health per 5 seconds
				
				
					BREAK THE FOUNDATIONS Nexus and Inhibitor Turret health is now divided into thirds. Turrets can only regenerate health up to the top of their current third.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Turret Gold
				More of turret reward gold is granted locally rather than globally.
				
					Similar to our bounty changes last patch, we're looking to decrease the number of truly global objectives in our game and allow players who have a large impact to feel that impact more personally. Accordingly, inner turrets will now provide more of their gold locally and less globally.
				
				
					INNER TURRET LOCAL GOLD REWARD 175 gold (split among nearby champions) ⇒ 300 gold (split among nearby champions)
				
				
					GLOBAL GOLD REWARD 125 gold (to every allied champion) ⇒ 100 gold (to every allied champion)

				Baron Nashor
				Attack speed decreased. Base corruption damage decreased. Special attacks no longer apply corruption
				
					Baron definitely does too much damage after Patch 8.10's changes.
				
				
					BARON ATTACK SPEED 0.75 ⇒ 0.625
				
				
					BASE CORRUPTION DAMAGE 120 ⇒ 60
				
				
					CORRUPTION DAMAGE RATIO 0.3 total attack damage ⇒ 0.2 total attack damage
				
				
					SPECIAL ATTACKS No longer apply corruption stacks
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Scuttle Crab
				Respawn time increased. Shrine duration increased.
				
					The action around Scuttle Crab is making for a good mini-objective, but it's currently up too often, forcing too much of a jungler's attention onto its continuous respawn. To compensate for fewer overall Scuttle Crabs, we're pushing some experience back into the basic jungle camps (detailed just below).
				
				
					RESPAWN TIME 135 seconds ⇒ 150 seconds
				
				
					SHRINE DURATION 75 seconds ⇒ 90 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Jungle Monsters
				Experience slightly increased at later levels.

		Last-Hit Assistance
	
If a basic attack would fail to kill a minion by 4 health or less, it will kill that minion.
This is solely to help transition players through the several highly disruptive patches. Every patch after Patch 8.11, we will reduce this number by 1. 

	ARAM
	
		
			
				
					The Butcher’s Bridge map returns until June 18 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Pyke joins the ARAM free-to-play rotation during this time.
					The following permanent changes are now part of ARAM:
				
				Available Champions Pool: During champ select, you may swap for a champ that’s been rerolled by any teammate
					Expanded free champs pool (triple the champions)
					Start-of-game base gates (similar to Summoner’s Rift)
					Earlier surrender options (8:00 unanimous, 12:00 standard)
					Champ Mastery adjustments (to make it a bit easier to get an S)
					\"True\" level 3 starts: You will reach level 4 much faster
				
					Along with some event-only gameplay tests:
				
				New assassin items: Ghostwalkers, Spectral Cutlass, and Bloodletter’s Veil
					Large area-of-effect heals on health pack pickup that affect both teams equally
					Removal of Warmog’s Armor and Dark Harvest nerf
				
					During the event, Battle Boost temporarily unlocks two skins instead of one.
					Read the full ARAM changes for more info.

	Instant Feedback
	
		
			
				We’re sprucing up reform cards with a clarity pass sometime this patch.
				
					Reform cards are getting some spring cleaning, so we added per-game tabs for chat logs, and made it more clear which chat is from pre-, mid-, or post-game.
