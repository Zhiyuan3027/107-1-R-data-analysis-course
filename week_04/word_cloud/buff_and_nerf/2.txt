  Happy Snowdown, summoners!We've mentioned a few times that there'd be one more set of balance changes before the end of the year. Well...here it is! \"7.24b—the b is for balance!\" Unlike standard patches, this one doesn't require
    a download, so if you're reading these notes within six-ish hours of publication, watch for a ticker to confirm we're live.Back to the patch! Today's big theme is toplane—particularly the fighters and items that call it home. Many have
    felt the pain of losing Fervor, and while we buffed a few in 7.24 proper, we're targeting a few more today. We're also looking at a few champs south of baron pit that are doing too well (~Hello Corki, my old friend~), and have power adjustments
    to the Sorcery path to boot. Worth mentioning: even though we're balancing about as many things as a regular patch, our changes are numbers-only (except for Zoe). Stability's the name of the game today.As a note for the patch notes themselves,
    we're trying a new structure that groups changes by theme, rather than content type. That also means we're writing context on a per-theme level, rather than per-change as usual (with a few exceptions). Let us know what you think!Wrapping
    up, we here in the patch notes crew wish you happy holidays and a tilt-free remainder of preseason. GGWP 2017; here's to 2018!

  Top Lane
    
      
        With the removal of Fervor, and Summon Aery being particularly good on poke top laners, the top lane landscape has been rough for fighters. We're buffing up some of the worst-hit fighters, giving the Tiamat line some love, making Giant Slayer
          less effective against fighter item builds, and bringing down certain ranged top laners who abuse the new poke masteries like Arcane Comet or Summon Aery.

      The mid landscape is in flux, thanks to preseason changes to runes and base magic resist. That's left a few champions well above or below the curve, and we're taking this moment to hit some of the more notable outliers.

Bot Lane
  
    
      The damage being thrown around bot lane is a bit too high for our liking, and a large part of that is the combination of sorcery poke and the all-in strength of lethality marksmen. On the poke end, Miss Fortune is spamming Make it Rain for Arcane
        Comet procs a bit too enthusiastically—rain is fine, but right now it's a downpour. For all-ins, the biggest non-lethaltiy offender is Leona, and the lethality changes we mentioned above cover the marksman side of the issue.

  Greetings Summoners,It's the final (sort of) patch of the preseason and that means a lot of tweaks based on our first round of data. The game always changes a decent amount this time of year, so we're looking to make sure that—heading into
    next season—most champions at least feel the same, and some might even have the potential to do more.A number of champions love the new runes and have been smashing the competition as a result, while others find themselves without
    the keystone they'd want. We're looking to give those characters some love in the meantime, and then we'll go from there.Some of the runes themselves are either on the strong or weak side, so there's some balance tuning coming through
    on that front. We want to make sure that we don't head into the winter break with huge outliers still hanging around, so we'll be doing another minor patch before then.Finally, we're rolling out a major update to the healthbars in the
    game, hoping to increase clarity overall and visibility on some of the less noticeable moments in the game. More on that below!

        The new trading landscape has done a lot to buff the trading patterns of supports while Bard has stayed pretty constant. As a result, he's a bit on the punishable side, so we're giving him some love.

        Passive shield duration increased. Q recast window increased.
        Fervor of Battle had been providing Camille with a good deal of sustained damage. Without that, she's losing more trades. Rather than straight up increasing her trade power, we're giving her more room to use Q2 more effectively (and potentially
          while protected by her passive shield).

        Darius lost bonus attack damage from both runes and Fervor of Battle when we switched to the new system. While he got a base attack damage buff at the same time, his passive scales with bonus—not total—attack damage, and his trading pattern has
          suffered as a result.

        Galio is struggling a bit, so we're buffing up his damage. However, we want to tie his strength to slightly riskier actions, like diving in with Justice Punch and landing a good Shield of Durand taunt. Essentially, as a beefy champion who also
          has the potential to dish out some damage, he should be rewarded for taking positional risks.

        Ivern
        Grove health cost decreased.
        Ivern's historically relied on Triggerseed's low cooldown to help him survive fights. However, the transition from Thunderlord's Decree to the burstier-but-higher-cooldown Electrocute has given aggressive junglers an easier time taking Ivern down
          before he gets a second shield off. We're offsetting this systemic shift by reducing the health costs Ivern pays for clearing his own camps.

        Base mana regen increased; mana regen growth decreased. Passive no longer procs on small units but heals more off everything else. W cooldown reduced when passive procs.
        Morgana's existing laning pattern is pretty uninspiring: Press W on wave, get health back, keep laning. We're sharpening that pattern to give her more clear success and failure cases, and give opponents better windows in which to punish her (or
          deny her lane sustain). Trimming back that generic power allows us to make solo lane Morgana a lot stronger when played well.

        Zoe
        W spell pickups last less long. E now travels less far, slows less, but lasts longer. 
        Zoe's Spell Thief pickups put a lot of pressure on her opponents. When they're on the ground, they're an extra burst of power they have to fear, and that can make it overwhelming to fight against her. Moreover, if an opponent does try to zone
          her away from the pickup, they have to do so for quite some time. Bringing that time down should give opponents more ability to exert influence in the lane.Separately, we fixed a bug that was making it very difficult to cast Sleepy
          Trouble Bubble through walls unless you got right next to them. Now that players are going to be able to cast from slightly farther away from walls, we're afraid that will simply give her a longer threat range than intended, so we're taking
          a bit of the overall range out of that ability.

        Zyra's one of the champions that makes us have long discussions about what a healthy gameplay pattern is, even more so when she's t(h)orn between being a midlaner or a support. It also made us think about what it means to have champions transitioning
          from one lane to another and what that means for the game in general. We always get super excited whenever we see champions having fun play patterns in more than one role. For Zyra especially, we found ways for her to thrive as a
          support in a healthier way, but it wasn't all flowers just yet. This set of changes should provide our favorite fern more agency to go where she wants or where her team needs her the most.

        Bramble Vest
        Reflect damage now has lower base damage but scales with armor.
        Bramble Vest is still proving too strong a spot-counter against basic attackers, thanks to the spike of strength it provides against them. We're working to dial that back and ensure it doesn't take over the laning phase.

        Sunfire Cape
        Aura damage increased.
        The two items that have enabled consistent laning patterns for tanks this season have been Sunfire Cape and Bramble Vest. We're not really happy with the play patterns that arise from either being the go-to item on tanks: Sunfire Cape tends to
          lead to overly high base damage on tanks with little cost in overall durability, while Bramble Vests makes playing basic-attacking champions in top lane overly prohibitive.However, without either of those items, it's become clear
          that tank laning patterns fall apart. At this point, it's clear that Sunfire Cape is the healthier dynamic, so we're reverting the changes from Patch 7.9, but we hope to revisit Sunfire Cape in the future.

		Waddup champs,
		Preseason is at full steam! After shipping the most urgent balance changes in a mid-patch update shortly after Runes Reforged launched, we've got a few (not-quite-as) urgent ones here in 7.23. From here on, we'll start getting back to our normal balance work (read: not just focusing on raw power with base stat changes). We discussed our preseason Runes balance philosophy on our boards, so if this intro wasn't enough, go read that instead! We're being super careful in this time of experimentation, and couldn’t be more excited to see what's coming out of all the theorycrafting.
		Past the balance side of things, we've adjusted post-30 EXP curves and the First Win of the Day mission reward based on your feedback. Hearing your thoughts is incredibly important to us, so please keep them coming! We're also knocking out a few longstanding feature requests: The Skins Tab, the ability to spectate Challengers, and about a year's worth of updates to the Game Info site all land this patch!
		We'd of course be remiss to go without mentioning League's newest trickster. 7.23 brings Zoe to the Rift, and thinking with portals will totally be a thing! Exercise caution—when Zoe's in play, things are not going to go the way you think.
		GLHF,

				Gragas
				Attack speed increased.
				
					Giving Gragas a bit of power that'll particularly help with his first jungle clear. \"Innate bonus attack speed\" is the same mechanic that we used last patch to compensate other junglers (Amumu, Maokai, etc): We're boosting Gragas' starting attack speed without increasing the value he gets from bonus attack speed elsewhere.
				
				Base stats
				
					newINNATE BONUS ATTACK SPEED 8% (level 1 attack speed: 0.625 ⇒ 0.675)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Illaoi
				Bugfixin'
				
					Or rather, buff-fixin'.
				
				Passive - Prophet of an Elder God
				
					BUFF-FIX Tentacle slams no longer fizzle if an enemy dies after being acquired as a slam target
				
				W - Harsh Lesson
				
					BUFF-FIX Similar to the above, any tentacles that would slam Illaoi's target now do so if her target dies during Harsh Lesson's leap animation
				
				
					CONSISTENCY Harsh Lesson's empowered attack can no longer be canceled (matching other empowered attacks)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jinx
				Flame Chompers stop in-progress movement abilities.
				
					Giving Jinx a bit more self-sufficiency against champs who dive her.
				
				E - Flame Chompers!
				
					newANKLE BITERS Enemies rooted by Flame Chompers now have any in-progress movement abilities stopped
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rammus
				Armor decreased.
				
					Rammus and Aftershock are a match made in heaven, but between his new keystone and Defensive Ball Curl, Rammus is rolling over the competition. We're reducing some of his innate tankiness to push him toward relying more on his cooldowns when he needs to armor up.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE ARMOR 40 ⇒ 36
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Shyvana
				Base attack damage decreased.
				
					Shyvana's emerged as one of the top performers in the jungle across a number of keystones. We're reducing her base attack damage so she doesn't gain quite as much value with the early attack speed many of her preferred Runes builds opt into.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 69 ⇒ 66
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Taliyah
				Health and armor growth stats increased.
				
					Though Taliyah started in a rocky spot when Runes launched, we've seen significant improvement as players continue to experiment with new builds. A bit more hardiness will let Taliyah maintain more aggressive positioning, particularly with Rune builds where she's chasing enemies down with Phase Rush.
				
				Base stats
				
					HEALTH GROWTH STAT 87 ⇒ 90
				
				
					ARMOR GROWTH STAT 3 ⇒ 3.5
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Mid-Patch 7.22 Balance Updates
				
					These changes were all released shortly after patch 7.22 as our first round of Runes followup (read: None of this is new!). Copying 'em here for completion's sake.
				
				Ivern
				
					Ivern doesn't have any Keystone that's particularly amazing for him, and he's feeling the lack of Windspeaker's Blessing more than most.
				
				
					TRIGGERSEED SHIELD 70/100/130/160/190 ⇒ 75/110/145/180/215

					Nunu also took a hit with the removal of Stoneborn Pact, so we're giving him some extra vitality early on.
				
				
					BASE HEALTH 540 ⇒ 590
				
				Ornn
				
					We didn't account for all the bonus damage Ornn's E gets from bonus armor and magic resist—woops!
				
				
					SEARING CHARGE DAMAGE 20/40/60/80/100 ⇒ 30/50/70/90/110

				Sona
				
					Sona's been having a blast on Runes Reforged, and while we want her to keep discovering new routes to success, having all paths lead to victory seems overbearing.
				
				
					BASE ARMOR 30 ⇒ 28
				
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 50.04 ⇒ 46

	Runes
	
		
			
				
				Summon Aery (Sorcery Keystone)
				Damage decreased.
				
					Keystones are supposed to have meaningful tradeoffs between each other, but at the moment Aery is just far and away the best for damage, thanks to how often it can be applied. We're looking to keep it as the lowest cadence Keystone between itself, Arcane Comet, and Electrocute, but that means its damage needs to come down a bit.
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 20-60 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 15-40 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					BUGFIX Aery now deals the correct adaptive damage type based on your stats
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Predator (Domination Keystone)
				Cooldown decreased.
				
					Predator has a steeper learning curve than many of our other Keystone Runes because it’s an active effect. However, with such a long cooldown, players don't get to use it regularly enough to progress along that learning curve. Decreasing the cooldown serves two purposes: Giving players more room to experiment with and master Predator, while bringing it more in line with other Keystones.
				
				
					COOLDOWN 180-120 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 150-100 seconds (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zombie Ward (Domination)
				Zombies carry gold, too.
				
					We've supported the \"kill something, get money\" feedback loop throughout our game so thoroughly that it feels weird not to get something from Zombie Wards.
				
				
					GRAVEROBBER Killing a Zombie Ward now grants one gold
				
			
		
	

	
		
			
				Runes Interface
				
					Some of the changes we did to Runes went undocumented when we first released the patch notes so TELL YOUR FRIENDS!
				
				
					HIDING PRESET PAGES You can now hide your preset pages in your inventory page. An option to hide them in champ select is coming in a future patch!
				
				
					FILTERING On the inventory page, you can now search for rune pages by title and filter by primary style
				
				More bugfixes
				Fixed a bug that caused rune selection to be interrupted when all players locked in their champions
					Annoying \"page is saved\" confirmation removed
					\"Show long description\" checkbox properly saves now
					Fixed cases where ambient audio persisted in the client at all times
					Various bugfixes to improve framerate issues in-game
				
		
	


	
		
			
				Runes Bugfixes
				Allies can no longer help you activate Electrocute if they're running it as well
					Arcane Comet can now properly proc off the empowered attack of Viktor's Q - Siphon Power
					Using a Kleptomancy-looted Peering Farsight Totem (blue ward) while also having a Farsight Totem in your inventory no longer puts your Farsight Totem on cooldown
					Ally portraits no longer incorrectly display an empty mana bar if their Manaflow Band Rune is off cooldown
					Wukong's R - Cyclone and Rakan's R - The Quickness now properly benefit from The Ultimate Hat's cooldown reduction

					Champions with clone abilities no longer trigger Presence of Mind when their clones expire

	Turrets
	
		
			
				Health increased. Turrets take more damage from minions.
				
					Over time, League of Legends has evolved to focus on 5-man grouping and teamfights. This can feel bad for players who want to opt into the split-push or wave control game, so we're tweaking minion functionality and tower tankiness to give them more room to succeed.
				
				
					BETTER ROCKS All turrets on Summoner's Rift have gained 300 health
				
				
					ROCK TERMITES Minions deal 50% ⇒ 40% reduced damage to turrets
				
				
					DISTANCE TRAINING After 20 minutes, minions gain +25 movement speed. This change will be enabled several days into the patch so we can more accurately track its impact.

	Rewards
	
		
			
				First Win of the Day
				
					We've heard folks asking for ways to gain Blue Essence while in between levels, especially so you can buy champions that would otherwise be just out of your reach. So we're converting some of the XP from the First Win of the Day boost into straight-up Blue Essence.
				
				
					CLOSE ENOUGH 575 XP ⇒ 50 Blue Essence + 400 XP
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Leveling Beyond 30
				
					Leveling difficulty will now normalize once you reach level 50 (before this change, each band of 10 levels up until level 150 required progressively more experience). To learn more about this change, check out this post.

	Skins Tab in the Collection
	
		
			
				See and sort your full collection of skins in one place!
				
					One of the biggest player requests from the client beta finally arrives—and in style.
				
				
					ALL SORTS OF SKINS Sort your skins collection by champion, champion mastery, tier, theme, or purchase date
				
				
					WINDOW SHOPPING Tick the box to \"Show Unowned\" skins and purchase them directly from the collection
				
				
					MAKE A SPLASH Click on any skin in the collection to see the full-sized version of the splash. If any chromas are available for that skin, you'll be able to see and purchase those as well.

					LEARN FROM THE BEST We’re adding the ability to spectate Challenger-tier games through the Ranked ladder on the profile page
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Game Info Webpage
	
		
			
				
					We're bringing leagueoflegends.com's champion and item pages back up to date during 7.23. As part of this refresh, the lore sections of the champion pages will now link out to their respective pages on Universe instead.
					Additionally, the old Runes and Masteries pages will be removed. We're working on building Runes Reforged into the site as well but won't have that ready for this patch.
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	In-Client Champion Bios
	
		
			
				
					Short character biographies have been created/adjusted for most champions, with another round coming soon. The full bios remain on Universe—these changes are to give a consistent and quick summary for each champion in the client.

	Skin Splash Portraits
	
		
			
				
					A lot of these were bad. Now they're not!

	New Game Mode: Overcharge
	
		
			
				
				
					Join the hunt in a 3v3 marksman-only deathmatch during the PROJECT: Hunters event. Destroy charge bots to overcharge your team, granting invulnerability, higher movespeed, and more points for champion kills. If your opponents overcharge, stick to the shadows until they power down.
					Kills grant one point. Overcharged kills grant five points. The first team to 50 points wins.

	Bugfixes
	
		
			
				Made several fixes to improve in-game FPS and performance, especially in games lasting longer than 35 minutes
					Made several fixes for issues that occurred if players left their client open for extremely long periods of time
					\"Center Camera on Champion\" now always puts your champion in the center of your screen, rather than doing nothing in Locked Camera mode or placing your champion at the last camera offset position in Semi-Locked Camera mode
					Emotes now work in custom games!
					Fixed a bug where Baron Nashor could spawn before Rift Herald returned to the Void

					Thresh's Q - Death Sentence chain once again disappears if he hits a spell shielded unit
					Fixed a bug with Lulu, Sona, and Ryze where multiple instances of the same shielding effect were stacking, rather than refreshing. (This bug mostly occurred at high levels of CDR.)
					Fixed a bug where basic attacks empowered by Blitzcrank's E - Power Fist or Vi's E - Excessive Force were fizzling if the buffs expired mid-attack. The empowered attacks now properly complete.
					Re-fixed a series of bugs where some channeled effects were interrupted through spell shields by hard crowd control
					Fixed a bug where if Ryze's target died during the cast time of W - Rune Prison or E - Spell Flux, he wouldn't get the cooldown reset effect of Q - Overload

			Hey team, Safelocked here. I'm the Lead Gameplay Producer, aka the Gameplay version of Lead Producer Joe \"Audible Chocolate\" New001, and before you dive into one of LoL’s biggest patch notes to date, I want to take a moment to recap this year. Side note: If you landed here looking for more Runes Reforged information, click here.
			Let’s start with class updates. Last preseason, we updated Assassins as a continuation of these (i.e. Juggernauts, Marksmen, Mages), and in midseason, we updated Tanks. After seeing the mixed impact of class updates though, we decided to move away from this approach to push individual champions further in bigger and more targeted ways. We went big with Warwick’s blood hunting, Galio’s colossal impact, Urgot’s infamous shotgun knees, and Eve’s charming mind games.
			We went more targeted with ability updates: smaller scale changes on champions that might’ve worked a few years ago but now needed some extra love to better define their space within LoL. There were a bunch of them starting with Alistar stampeding his way, to giving Rek'Sai more teeth, to more recently bringing Azir's groove back and modernizing Xin Zhao.
			We also welcomed new champions: Xayah and Rakan as the ultimate power-couple; Kayn, the wall-walking shadow reaper; Ornn, your resident blacksmith demigod—and we have one more bubbling up soon.
			Supports got a few more legendary item options like Redemption and Knight’s Vow, and Rift Herald’s evolved to become a meaningful strategic objective on Summoner’s Rift. 
			Now it’s finally preseason, and we’re ready to introduce some big changes we've been working on. We’re combining runes and masteries into one new system that lets you customize your playstyle, streamlines your choices, and is free for everyone so we’re all on the same playing field. Additionally, you’ll be able to progress beyond level 30 and get more satisfying rewards that level up with you.
			We've been talking about preseason changes for about six months now, and if you haven't heard about them just yet: They’ll look crazy. They might actually be crazy too—it's preseason, after all! We’re looking to discover with you, outplay each other, and learn again. We’re in our most ambitious preseason yet, and we're excited to chart this unknown territory together.
			See you on the Rift,

	Champions
	
		
			
				
					Our old rune system gave champions a lot of raw base stats, and especially early game those stats heavily impact the feeling of basic actions, like last-hitting and jungle clears. We want a lot of the instincts players have about the game to remain consistent, so we're pumping a lot of base stats directly back into the champions themselves. For the most part, this means Health, Armor, or Attack Damage, but we've also taken this opportunity to introduce a new stat into the game: bonus Attack Speed at level 1.

				Coin line, Spellthief's Edge line, and Targon's Shield line
				
					Similar to the base stat adjustments, we also want to make sure that supports have the ability to spec into Bandit. To make it less of a direct rune tradeoff, we're pushing that passive into support items.
				
				
					HEY! All support starting items now have Bandit as a passive effect
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Targon's Shield Line
				
					The new runes have given many ranged supports much higher poke damage in the early game, making it more punishable for Tanks to cash their Spoils of War stacks. We're giving the heal on Targon's a small bump to ensure they still have ways to secure their gold.
				
				
					SPOILS OF WAR Killing a minion with a Spoils of War charge heals for 2% of missing health in addition to the flat heal

				Stopwatch
				
					Defensive items like Zhonya's and Guardian's Angel can do a lot to get you through burst-heavy team fights, but the time it takes to build them is so long that many times that key fight you needed them most has already passed by the time you complete them. Stopwatch is meant to be that stopgap. It lets you invest towards the long term solution and still get that single moment of reprisal when you need it most.
				
				
					COST 600 gold
				
				
					UNIQUE ACTIVE Use Stopwatch to get into Stasis. Statis make Champions invulnerable and untargetable for 2.5 seconds, but unable to move, attack, cast spells, or use items during this time.
				
				
					I'LL STILL CARRY THIS WATCH Activating Stopwatch will transform it into Broken Stopwatch, which has no use but can still be upgraded. After breaking one Stopwatch, the shopkeeper will only sell you Broken Stopwatches.

	Experience
	
		
			
				Takedown Experience
				
					When we implemented the team-catchup experience, we'd intended it as a mechanic to keep supports relevant in levels, but the impact has largely been to snowball teams which are already ahead.
				
				
					[REMOVED] NO LONGER RELEVANT Earning a kill or assist while below your team’s average level no longer grants bonus experience
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Jungle XP
				
					Comeback jungle experience is important in ensuring that an early game deficit isn't too hard to come back from, but at the moment it's creating some weird patterns. First, it's just too much overall, so we're cutting the total amount significantly. Second, linking it to little monsters has made one side of the map (Raptors and Krugs) disproportionately important to secure. Putting the bonus experience on the large monsters instead balances the sides out, while also making it more rewarding to counter-jungle.
					We're also taking this moment to standardize jungle cs indicators. Because camps had wildly different numbers of monsters in them, cs becomes a pretty poor marker of gold. Is the enemy jungler outfarming you or have they just taken Krugs and Raptors twice? With this change it should be easier to ballpark a jungler's strength/lead from comparative cs.
				
				
					COMEBACK EXPERIENCE 30 XP per level behind on any monster ⇒ 50 XP per level behind only on Large or Epic Monsters
				
				
					[REMOVED] First clear experience reduction no longer applies to Wolf camp or small Razorbeaks
				
				
					DING You'll now be able to reach level 2 by starting at the Wolf camp

	Extra damage to minions
	
		
			
				
					With the removal of masteries that brought a bit of PvE damage to the table, we wanted to ensure that champions didn't feel overly weak against lane minions. We will be continuing to evaluate the power of this as we see adjustments to Runes and champion changes.
				
				
					IT HURTS Basic attacks deal 5 bonus damage to lane minions

	Minion, Monsters, and Ambient Gold (and things related to it)
	
		
			
				
					There's a lot of waiting around at the start of the game, and even with invades, there's still some downtime. We're trying to reduce the idle time, so you'll see things like Bard Chimes, Skarner's Crystals, and Smite Cooldown being enabled a little bit quicker. To compensate those 10 seconds, the Homestart effect is also a tad stronger

	Uncapped Leveling
	
		
			
				   
					 
				
				
					The level 30 level cap has been removed, and the new cap is… infinity!
					Instead of getting IP after every game, you'll receive a capsule each time you level up. Capsules almost always contain champion shards. Exceptions to this will be on certain milestone levels such as 50, 75, 100, etc, where you can get extra goodies. When these levels are reached, you'll get exclusive rewards to show off your status in-game. These rewards include a special high-level ward skin, milestone emotes which you can upgrade using blue essence, and at very high milestone levels, maybe even a gemstone.

	IP turns into Blue Essence
	
		
			
				   
					 
				
				
					We're connecting the leveling and loot systems by merging IP and blue essence. The newer, bluer essence will work in all the places IP and BE worked before, including loot and the champion store. Everything in the store will cost the same as it did in the old, IP-based system—for example, a newer champ like Kayn will be 6300 BE.

					IP boosts are being removed from the store. XP boosts will still be available. Any active IP boosts will get automatically converted to XP boosts.
					With rewards being tied to leveling up, XP boosts helps increasing the speed you unlock content (you'll level faster, thus earn capsules faster). To reflect this, we’ll be increasing the price of XP boosts to be closer to the value of an IP boosts. Check out the new price table in the FAQ.

					Claim the incredible power of Ascension to conquer the Crystal Scar of Shurima. Ascension is now live from 11/10/17 at 12:00 p.m. PT - 11/14/17 at 04:00 a.m. PT and 11/17/17 at 12:00 p.m. PT - 11/21/17 at 04:00 a.m. PT.
				
				   
					 
				
				
					TL;DR:
				
				Go 5v5 to claim the incredible power of Ascension by taking down Ancient Ascendant Xerath. Use Ascension to conquer the Crystal Scar of Shurima.
					First team to reach 200 points wins. Score:
					
						1 point for champion kills.
							3 points for capturing a Shuriman relic.
							5 points for landing the killing blow on an Ascended champion.
							2 points for each kill you acquire while Ascended.
						
				
					Go forth. Conquer. Ascend.
				
				Ascension Changelist
				You can now use Enhanced Recall from anywhere on the map while in the play space
				
					NO HEALS Fountain healing is still disabled.
				
				
					I JUST DIED FOR THAT This change enables you to shop and buy items during the game, without having to die to do it.
				
				Runes Reforged is now available on Ascension
				
					You can customize and select your runes, however we have swapped out some of the runes that are not compatible with Ascension by default; if you have these particular runes in your page, they will be automatically swapped for you once in game
				
				
					
						
							Waterwalking
							
								Waterwalking gives you movement speed while walking in the River, which wasn’t useful in the desert. Waterwalking will become Scorch, which allows your next ability to set the champion on fire, dealing damage.
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							Zombie Ward
							
								Zombie Ward spawns a new, allied ward wherever you kill an enemy ward (or a new allied ward when your allied wards expire); however, there are no wards in Ascension… so, we’re testing out Ghost Poro. Ghost Poro allows you to summon a poro after entering a brush. The poro will stay behind and give you vision until you summon a new one, or until an enemy scares it away.
								If Ghost Poro doesn’t happen, we’ll be swapping Zombie Ward out for something more useful regardless.
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							Minion Dematerializer
							
								Minion Dematerializer lets you kill and absorb lane minions… if you had any! So you'll be getting Future’s Market instead. Future's Market lets you enter debt to the shopkeeper to buy items. Careful with those interest rates!
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							Kleptomancy
							
								Kleptomancy lets you auto attack champions and get gold and potentially consumables. However, since we balance gold and disable consumables in Ascension, we’ve disabled this rune as well. You'll be getting Glacial Augment, which gives your auto attacks a slow effect on champions. If you slow them with an active item, it’ll freeze the ground around them for five seconds.
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							Demolish
							
								Demolish allows you to make powerful attacks against turrets. The only turret that exists in Ascension is Azir’s, when Xerath is de-spawned, so we’ve disabled this rune.The one you'll be getting instead is Font of Life, which allows you to mark an enemy when you have impaired their movement. Allied champions will heal when they attack marked enemies.
							
						
					
				
				
					
						
							Overgrowth
							
								Overgrowth increases your maximum HP for monsters and minions dying near you, but there are no monsters or minions in Ascension. There's always Second Wind though, which allows you to heal for some amount of your missing HP after being hit by an enemy champion.

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 7.21, the last one before preseason starts in earnest. We’ve got a lot a big changes coming down the pipeline that will shake up the game, so this patch is a bit on the smaller side. That being said, we’re hitting a few outliers and looking to make playstyle changes to a few champions.
		A few tanks - Galio, Sejuani, and Rammus - are sitting at far too much baseline effectiveness. We’re bringing that down, and in Galio’s case, giving him a bit more scaling to play with. We’re also taking a look at two juggernauts - Udyr and Urgot - and looking to give them a more reliable late game. Finally, we’re tweaking some items that have either dominated the landscape (hey there, Ardent Censer) or been underwhelming for awhile.
		Next patch brings Runes Reforged, and with it will come a ton of change, but for now get out there and enjoy the last patch of Season 7!
		Cheers,

				10/26/2017 Galio Hotfix
				
					We intended to buff a more aggressive Galio and he's certainly stronger after the changes. However, while we had thought that the new Galio would build some ability power on top of building tanky, we've seen a lot of glass cannon builds. As a result, his damage is far higher than we foresaw, and it's warping his gameplay by not allowing opponents any time to react, let alone wait out Idol of Durand and kill him back.
				
				Q - Winds of War
				
					INITIAL DAMAGE RATIO .9 ability power ⇒ .8 ability power
				
				
					TORNADO RATIO 3% Percent Max Health per 100 AP per tick ⇒ 1% Max Health per 100 AP per tick (3% total)

				Fixed a bug where Ancient Krug spawned with less attack damage than intended at level 3.

	Champions
	
		
			
				

				Azir
				


				Q damage reduced at later ranks. Soldier damage reduced at later levels.


				
					We’re happy seeing Azir succeed across a wider skill range than “only the best,” but now that everyone’s had time to acclimate to the Emperor’s new moves, it’s apparent his damage is a bit high.
				

				Q - Conquering Sands


				
					DAMAGE 70/100/130/160/190 ⇒ 70/95/120/145/170
				

				W - Arise!


				Soldier damage unchanged from levels 1-5, reduced by 5 thereafter.


				
					SOLDIER DAMAGE 60/62/64/66/68/75/80/85/95/105/115/125/135/145 /155/165/175/185 ⇒ 60/62/64/66/68/70/75/80/90/100/110/120/130/140 /150/160/170/180
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Ekko
				


				Passive damage to monsters increased.


				
					We’re okay with Ekko going jungle when he does so in a healthy way (read: as an assassin, not a tank). However, when we last changed his passive we made it a tad harder for AP Ekko to succeed in the jungle. This change comes to make Ekko a bit more viable in that role with as little risk as possible to his solo laning characteristics.
				

				Passive - Z-Drive Resonance


				
					DAMAGE TO MONSTERS 100% ⇒ 200%
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Evelynn
				


				E percent health minimum damage set.


				
					Because Whiplash doesn’t kill a mini krug. We’re still tracking Evelynn’s performance post-update and may need to make more substantial changes, but this one felt pretty simple.
				

				E - Whiplash


				
					MINIMUM DAMAGE FROM PERCENT HEALTH 0 ⇒ 25
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Galio
				


				Q and E base damage decreased. Passive, Q, W, E ability power ratios increased. W physical damage reduction decreased.


				
					We’d like to give more room for Galio to play aggressively and be rewarded for high impact plays. After all, we’re talking about a gargoyle who leaps across the map and justice punches his opponents. Upping the AP ratios on his abilities gives daring Galio players more room to show off their skills, but in exchange we’re trimming some of his baseline effectiveness. With less base damage and lower durability against physical damage, he might not be the priority pick we’ve seen in pro play, but he’ll have a clear niche in solo queue.
				

				Passive - Colossal Smash


				
					RATIO 0.4 ability power ⇒ 0.7 ability power
				

				Q - Winds of War


				
					BASE DAMAGE 60/95/130/165/200 ⇒ 50/80/110/140/170
				


				
					RATIO 0.75 ability power ⇒ 0.9 ability power
				


				
					% MAXIMUM HEALTH DAMAGE OVER TIME 2% target’s maximum health per half-second ⇒ 3% target’s maximum health per 100 ability power, per half-second
				

				W - Shield of Durand


				
					MAGICAL DAMAGE REDUCTION 20/25/30/35/40% (+8% per 100 bonus magic resist) ⇒ 20/25/30/35/40% (+8% per 100 bonus magic resist) (+5% per 100 ability power)
				


				
					PHYSICAL DAMAGE REDUCTION same as magical damage reduction ⇒ half of magical damage reduction
				

				E - Justice Punch


				
					BASE DAMAGE 100/140/180/220/260 ⇒ 100/130/160/190/220
				


				
					RATIO 0.7 ability power ⇒ 0.9 ability power
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Gangplank
				


				Q gold on kill increased.


				
					The scaling pirate isn’t grabbing the gold he needs to get ahead, so we’re pushing a few more doubloons at him.
				

				Q - Parrrley


				
					GOLD ON KILL 2/3/4/5/6 ⇒ 3/4/5/6/7
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Rammus
				


				W % armor bonus increased at later ranks. W flat magic resist and % decreased.


				
					Rammus was shaping up to be a tank of all trades, so we’re resharpening his identity to be more oriented against teams that rely heavily on physical damage—as originally intended.
				

				W - Defensive Ball Curl


				
					ARMOR BONUS 50/55/60/65/70% ⇒ 50/60/70/80/90%
				


				
					MAGIC RESIST BONUS 20 ⇒ 10
				


				
					MAGIC RESIST BONUS 50/55/60/65/70% ⇒ 25/30/35/40/45%
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Sejuani
				


				Innate armor and magic resist reduced but passive grants more at later levels. Passive shield duration and cooldown better early, worse late. E base damage reduced.


				
					Sejuani’s a bit too hard to kill, even when her frost armor’s down. She’s… a tank, so we’re not looking to make her squishy, but a few adjustments to Sej’s base stats and Fury of the North are in order. She’ll be roughly as durable as ever while armored up, but easier to take down after her passive’s fallen off. We’ve also standardized the duration and cooldown of her shield to make it easier for opponents to reliably play around Fury of the North’s protection.
					Beyond durability, we’re also lowering the damage Permafrost deals. Most of Sejuani’s damage against frozen targets comes from attacking them after they’re iced, so the freeze damage itself doesn’t need to be quite as chunky.
				

				Base stats


				
					BASE ARMOR 27 ⇒ 22
				


				
					ARMOR GROWTH 4 ⇒ 3
				


				
					BASE MAGIC RESIST 32.1 ⇒ 27.1
				


				
					MAGIC RESIST GROWTH 1.25 ⇒ 0.75
				

				Passive - Fury of the North


				
					FLAT BONUS RESISTANCES 20/60/100 ⇒ 20/70/120
				


				
					SHIELD LINGER DURATION 1/2/3 seconds ⇒ 2 seconds at all ranks
				


				
					COOLDOWN 15/12/9 seconds ⇒ 12 seconds at all ranks
				

				E - Permafrost


				
					DID YOU KNOW Tooltip now mentions Permafrost’s displacement effect
				


				
					FREEZE DAMAGE 40/60/80/100/120 ⇒ 20/30/40/50/60
				


				
					SHATTER DAMAGE 10/15/20% target’s maximum health (Unchanged. Also technically part of Fury of the North.)
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Udyr
				


				Attack damage per level increased. Tiger strike scaling total attack damage ratio increased. Phoenix strike ability power ratio increased.


				
					Udyr is pretty far away from where we’d like to see him, both as a champion and as a juggernaut. We don’t think this solves his problems completely, but we want to do something so that picking Udyr doesn’t always feel like the wrong decision. Dialing up his late game damage scaling should help Udyr feel worthwhile when he does manage to get on—and stick to—the right targets.
				

				Base stats


				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH STAT 3.2 ⇒ 5
				

				Q - Tiger Stance


				
					TIGER STRIKE RATIO 120/130/140/150/160% total attack damage ⇒ 120/135/150/165/180% total attack damage
				

				R - Phoenix Stance


				
					PHOENIX STRIKE RATIO 0.45 ability power ⇒ 0.6 ability power
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Urgot
				


				Passive damage decreased at early ranks but cooldown decreased at later ranks. Q detonates more quickly.


				
					When Urgot succeeds, we feel like he’s in a pretty nice spot, but he’s not hitting that mark often enough. A lack of reliability on Corrosive Charge and Fear Beyond Death is putting too much burden on Urgot players and not enough on his opponents, so we’re sharpening those mechanics. We’re also giving his legs shorter cooldowns in the late game but less damage early on to shift some of his power out of lane and into teamfights.
				

				Passive - Echoing Flames


				
					LEG COOLDOWN 30/25/20/15/10 (at levels 1/6/9/11/13) ⇒ 30/20/10/5/2.5 (at levels 1/6/9/11/13). No longer scales off of cooldown reduction from items.
				


				
					DAMAGE PER LEG 4.5/5.25/6/7/8% target’s maximum health (at levels 1/6/9/13/15) ⇒ 2/3/4/6/8% target’s maximum health (at levels 1/6/9/11/13)
				

				Q - Corrosive Charge


				
					MANA CAST 35/40/45/50/55 ⇒ 50 at all ranks
				


				
					TIME BEFORE DETONATION 0.85 seconds ⇒ 0.5 seconds
				

				R - Fear Beyond Death


				
					MISSILE SPEED 2100 ⇒ 3200
				

				Bugfixes


				
					SORRY, URGOT Sterak’s Gage is no longer listed in Urgot’s recommended items (since it’s now melee only)
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Xin Zhao
				


				
					Xin Zhao’s been faring well since his recent ability update. We’re sprucing up his recommended items to better advise aspiring Seneschals.
				


				
					HERE’S A TIP Xin Zhao’s recommended items have been updated!
				
			
		
	


	Back to top
	


	Items
	
		
			
				

				Ardent Censer
				


				Attack speed and on-hit damage reduced.


				
Ardent Censer has been making waves (and winds) in bot lane for some time. For enchanters’ purchasing decisions—and as a result, the support landscape—to remain robust, this item needs more clear points of weakness. These changes make Ardent Censer weaker early on, so rushing Ardent Censer won’t always be the best choice for enchanters.
				


				
					ATTACK SPEED BUFF 20-35% ⇒ 10-30%
				


				
					ON-HIT MAGIC DAMAGE BUFF 20-35 ⇒ 5-20
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Frozen Heart
				


				Armor increased.


				
					Frozen Heart has been outshined by other tank items, with Thornmail, Randuin’s Omen, and Iceborn Gauntlet all occupying nearby niches and crowding it out. We’re honing in on its strength as the pure armor item to give tanks more reasons to opt into it.
				


				
					ARMOR 90 ⇒ 100
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Tear of the Goddess
				


				Stacking effect can now occur up to three times every 12 seconds.


				
					Stacking Tear often incentivizes odd behaviors, such as using abilities while simply walking down the lane or standing still at the base. We want to make it easier for Tear to be stacked when you’d already be casting abilities, such as lane trades, teamfights, farming, and so on.Editor’s Note: I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Mystic Shots fired at the shoulders of Ornn. I watched Overloads glitter in the dark near the Base Gates. All those abilities were lost in time, like Tears in rain. Time to stack.
				


				
					LESS QQ Can gain up to two stacks every 8 seconds ⇒ Can gain up to three stacks every 12 seconds
				


				
					THE OTHERS This change also impacts Seraph’s Embrace and Manamune
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				

				Manamune
				


				Mana per stack increased.


				
					Read Tear of the Goddess context!
				


				
					MORE PEW PEW +4 mana per stack ⇒ +5 mana per stack
				
			
		
	


	
		
			
				Item Pings


				
					We’re adding some useful information to a few item pings!
				


				Tear of the Goddess, Manamune, Archangel's Staff


				
					TEAR (NOT) FULLY STACKED Pinging Tear of the Goddess, Manamune, or Archangel’s Staff will now display how many charges you have
				

				Duskblade of Draktharr


				
					SEE THAT I AM UNSEEN Pinging Duskblade of Draktharr now tells your team whether you’re currently unseen or not

					Team up to overcome the cursed Doom Bots of Doom and their evil overlord before everything you love and cherish is doomed. Doom Bots is available from 10/26/17 at 12:00 p.m. PT - 11/7/17 at 04:00 a.m. PT.

					Survive and defeat the devilish little horror behind it all. Hut, two, three, four...

	Client Settings
	
		
			
				
					We’ve turned off the ability to turn off the client while in-game. The gains from that setting have been made redundant elsewhere (LCU), and the increased time in client booting up after a game is resulting in players missing honor voting and the end of game chat.

		Welcome to another patch, team.
		If you've got the sneaking feeling that someone's behind you, you might not be crazy. Evelynn's update is here, bringing the Widowmaker Agony's Embrace back in a brand new way. Should you find yourself on the wrong side of a Hate Spike or three, we've got you covered: the Emotes system launches globally this patch, offering new ways to let friends and foes alike know how you really feel.
		Balance-wise, 7.20's on the lighter side of things, particularly compared to last patch. We're hard at work preparing the way for Runes Reforged, and given how much of a shakeup League's about to see, we're primarily reserving patch work for long-term wins like the Sterak's update below.
		That'll do it for this patch! Best of luck on the Rift, particularly if you're sleep deprived from playing League and watching Worlds.

				Brand
				Brand gets mana when he kills an Ablaze unit.
				
					It’s been a hot second since we’ve seen Brand melting face in mid. Mana efficiency’s one of his more noteworthy problems: High costs keep his bot lane harass in check, but solo Brand can’t avoid paying those costs since he has to clear minion waves. Giving the Burning Vengeance his own form of the Doran’s Ring passive puts a bit more gas in Brand's tank without causing bot lane to combust as a result. This won’t solve all Brand’s problems, but it’s an important step toward adding fuel back to his mid lane fire.
				
				Passive - Blaze
				
					newKINDLING Brand gains 6/8/10/12/14/16/18 mana (at levels 1/3/6/9/12/15/18) when he kills a unit afflicted by Blaze. (If Brand’s abilities instantly kill a unit before Blaze is applied, he doesn’t get mana back.)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Graves
				Health regen increased. Q first shot scaling increased.
				
					Graves isn’t getting ahead in the scenarios he should. The Outlaw is constantly being outpaced in the early game and is not able to get his ball rolling enough to dictate the game. With a little bit more health and damage in his rotation, Graves should to be able to clear the jungle without having to have perfect mechanics—and do so a little bit faster, enabling him to scale properly.
				
				Base stats
				
					HEALTH REGEN 1.34 (6.67 per 5) ⇒ 1.6 (8 per 5)
				
				Q - End of the Line
				
					FIRST SHOT RATIO 0.8 bonus attack damage ⇒ 1.0 bonus attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Karma
				Mantra cooldown refund on hitting enemies increased.
				
					One of the keys to mastering Karma is optimising Mantra usage for every situation, and with these changes she’ll be able to do that more often. As long as she’s beating on enemy champions, Karma will have more access to Mantra in the late game.
				
				Passive - Gathering Fire
				
					MANTRA COOLDOWN REDUCTION 2/2.5/3 seconds per enemy champion hit (1/1.25/1.5 for basic attacks) ⇒ 2/3/4 seconds per enemy champion hit (1/1.5/2 for basic attacks)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ornn
				W deals max health damage instead of current health. E more reliably hits terrain. R reactivation no longer has a cast time.
				
					Ornn’s come a long way since his release a few patches back, and while we’re not looking to make massive power shifts today, we do want to address a few things that feel off about the guy. Shifting Bellows Breath from current to max health damage will make finishing off low-health opponents less of a Sisyphean challenge. Additionally, we’re addressing weird cases where Searing Charge narrowly missed terrain despite looking like a solid hit, as well as making Call of the Forge God significantly smoother when Ornn redirects his ram buddy with a good old-fashioned Freljordian kiss.
				
				W - Bellows Breath
				
					DAMAGE 15/17.5/20/22.5/25% target's current health ⇒ 12/14/16/18/20% target's maximum health
				
				E - Searing Charge
				
					TERRAIN COLLISION RANGE Ornn’s hitbox plus 100 additional range ⇒ 150 additional range

					removedREACTIVATION CAST TIME Headbutting the giant ram no longer has an 0.35 second cast time
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Tahm Kench
				Passive damage increased and scales at earlier levels. Tahm can spit out Devoured targets earlier. Abyssal Voyage no longer briefly locks Tahm out of casting Devour.
				
					Tahm’s been held back by a few lengthy lockouts on Devour and Abyssal Voyage, preventing him from making quick decisions. Lightening these restrictions will give the River King a much-needed power-up. For good measure, we’re also giving Tahm a more direct buff via the damage on An Acquired Taste, particularly when it comes to how early he can access its maximum damage.
				
				Passive - An Acquired Taste
				
					DAMAGE PER STACK 1/1.25/1.5% Tahm’s maximum health at levels 1/11/16 ⇒ 1.25/1.5/1.75% Tahm’s maximum health at levels 1/7/13
				
				
					MAXIMUM DAMAGE 3/3.75/4.5% Tahm’s maximum health ⇒ 3.75/4.5/5.25% Tahm’s maximum health
				
				W - Devour
				
					REGURGITATION LOCKOUT 2 seconds ⇒ 1 second
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug with Tahm Kench’s Tongue Lash + Devour combo where, if Tongue Lash dealt enough damage to kill the target minion, regurgitating the minion wouldn’t do anything
				
				R - Abyssal Voyage
				
					removedLOCKJAW Devour is no longer locked out for 1 second after teleporting

				Sterak's Gage
				Base percent base attack damage increased. Health increased. Lifeline no longer increases percent base attack damage, instead adds Tenacity.
				
					Sterak’s Gage is supposed to function as one of the keystone items for juggernauts, alongside Dead Man’s Plate. While DMP helps juggernauts overcome their natural immobility and make it into a teamfight, Sterak’s Gage is the item that lets them stay in that fight. Right now, it’s not really hitting that goal.
					One of the biggest weaknesses juggernauts face is their susceptibility to crowd control. Without gap-closers they often spend a whole fight getting kited before they die. We’re tasking the new Sterak’s Gage with solving that problem and shifting some of its power into Tenacity on Lifeline. On top of that, we think Sterak’s Gage could use some raw power, so we’re shoring up its base stats, especially its base attack damage amp.
					However, with these changes, we’re going to have to make Sterak’s Gage melee only. With increased damage, it will once again be enticing to marksmen, but they already have enough anti-assassination tools. Adding Sterak’s into the mix would simply be one too many. The other non-juggernaut group worth mentioning is the cadre of Trinity Force fighters—your Camilles, your Jaxes. Trinity Force’s spellblade passive and the freshly-buffed base AD multiplier on Sterak’s make for an attractive combo, but between the lower base AD these champs have and the smaller Lifeline shields they’ll get (less bonus health in their builds), we’re alright letting them experiment for the moment.
				
				
					BUILD PATH Jaurim’s Fist + Long Sword + 1050 gold ⇒ Jaurim’s Fist + Pickaxe + Ruby Crystal + 725 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2600 gold ⇒ 3200 gold
				
				
					HEALTH 400 ⇒ 450
				
				
					removedI’M ALWAYS ANGRY No longer gives additional % base attack damage for 8 seconds when Lifeline triggers
				
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE INCREASE 30% ⇒ 50%
				
				
					newUP CLOSE AND PERSONAL Can only be purchased by melee champions. Form-swapping champions only benefit from the base attack bonus buff while in melee form. Shield persists through form-swapping from melee to ranged.
				
				
					newWAIT FOR IT Shield waits 0.75 seconds before it begins decaying
				
				
					newI’M THE JUGGERNAUT Now gives 30% tenacity for 8 seconds when Lifeline triggers
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jaurim's Fist
				Flat health increased. Stacks required to fill Jaurim’s Fist decreased.
				
					Jaurim’s Fist takes a bit too long to stack up in power. Nothin’ more to see here.
				
				
					HEALTH 150 ⇒ 200
				
				
					MAX STACKS 30 ⇒ 20 (still 5 health per stack)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ancient Coin Line
				Coins restore less mana.
				
					Ancient Coin’s mana restore is meant to allow supports to use their abilities frequently, provided they’re willing to risk walking into the minion wave to pick up their coins. Odd as it sounds, Coin’s mana restore is so generous it’s disincentivizing supports from taking the intended risks. When blue coins are too potent, supports can afford to miss drops while still having enough mana to stay in lane. Why risk taking damage (let alone death) if you’re not even close to OOM?
					In this regard, reducing Coin’s mana restore makes the cost of missing a drop higher, since Coin users will need to more consistently pick up their blue coins to stay in lane. That in turn makes it easier for opponents to force Coin users back to base, whether due to low health (they took damage while grabbing coins) or low mana (they didn’t grab their coins).
				
				
					BLUE COIN REWARD 10% missing mana (min. 15) ⇒ 6% missing mana (min. 10)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Spellthief's Edge
				Ability power increased.
				
					Giving Spellthief’s supports a bit more oomph for their early game aggression. Remember how we just said Coin users will have to walk up to the minion wave more frequently? Go punish them for it.
					Note that this isn’t +5 AP to every Spellthief’s item—just Spellthief’s itself.
				
				
					ABILITY POWER 5 ⇒ 10

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to 7.19, the one where Worlds patch is finally in the rearview mirror and we can introduce some of the bigger changes we’ve been working on. There’s a lot this time around, so let’s dive right in!
		First, we’ve got Ardent Censer and Janna, both of which have been warping the bot game landscape for awhile. We’re looking to put a clearer strength profile on both of them, and - in Janna’s case - making sure she has more punishable weaknesses as a tradeoff for her late game strength.
		We’re also taking this opportunity to give Azir an ability update at this point, trimming a lot of his extraneous strengths (range), but also upgrading his damage. With clearer weaknesses to exploit, we’ll be able to leave Azir in a healthier place than in previous patches.
		Finally, Xin Zhao hasn’t been touched since we removed Devourer a year and a half ago. We’re looking into his kit to give him a clearer identity.
		There's a lot of updated champions this patch, so brush up on the changes before you hop onto the Rift!

				9/27/2017 Balance Update
			
			
				Janna
			
			
				When we updated Janna, we wanted to avoid hitting her too hard alongside the changes to Ardent Censer. As a result, we went too far in that direction and she has ended up pretty overtuned, and we're bringing her base stats down as an immediate response. Throughout the patch - and leading into the next one - we'll be evaluating her power and how she's expressing it.
			
			
				BASE MOVEMENT SPEED 335 ⇒ 320
			
			
				BASE MANA 409.52 ⇒ 350
			
			
				BASE HEALTH 525 ⇒ 500
			
			
				LIGHT BREEZE W - Zephyr's mana cost has been increased to 40/50/60/70/80 ⇒ 50/60/70/80/90
			
		
	



	
		
			
				9/28/2017 Balance Update
			
			
				Janna
			
			
			After the earlier changes, Janna is still pretty strong. Our goal was to weaken her overall (especially in her ability to passively protect an ally), but also to incentivize her to trade with autos in lane. Right now, her autos are not just worth trading with, they're strong, so we're dialing that back. We're also bringing her shield values down to continue weakening her passive protective ability. 
			
			
				IT WAS WINDY Passive - Tailwind percent of bonus movement speed dealt as magic damage reduced at early levels from 35% ⇒ 15/25/35% at levels 1/7/13
			
			
				SHIELDS DOWN E - Eye of the Storm shield decreased from 80/120/160/200/240 ⇒ 70/105/140/175/210

				Azir
				Ability update; check out the below context and prior dev blog for more information.
				
					Azir has been a League balance problem for awhile. Rather than tweak him patch after patch, we sidelined Shurima’s Emperor for a little while, choosing instead to focus on his eventual mini-update. This is that mini-update. For a deep dive into his changes, check out our dev blog.
					Here’s the TL;DR, though. Azir—unlike most long-ranged champions—is hard to kill even when you do manage to get on him, and if you get tooclose, he can even counter-initiate with a timely Shurima Shuffle. As a result, experienced Azir players were really hard to punish. Azir’s mobility, and playmaking potential are super cool, but to keep those and allow players to fight back, we needed to bring his range down to not-artillery levels and focus on his identity as a mobile, sustained damage dealer.

				Xin Zhao
				Ability update; check out the below context and prior dev blog for more information.
				
					Xin Zhao finds himself a character without an identity at a times, and we wanted to give him something specific to excel at. We eventually settled on the idea of Xin Zhao as a duelist, but we wanted to differentiate him from the controlled dueling of Fiora or the hunt and isolate dueling of Kha’Zix. Xin Zhao, a former gladiator, excels in creating duels amidst a teamfight, and we wanted his kit to reflect that.
				
				Base Stats
				
					BASE ATTACK SPEED .676 ⇒ .645
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED SCALING FACTOR 2.6% ⇒ 3.5%
				
				Passive - Determination
				
					newSTRONG AS A RAGING FIRE Every third attack deals 20/40/60/80% (at levels 1/6/11/16) of total AD as bonus damage

				Aatrox
				Now unstoppable during Q’s descent. R bonus attack range increased.
				
					Aatrox is struggling to impose himself in teamfights these days. We're focusing on improving his access to priority targets: Dark Flight is now a more reliable tool for diving the backline, while Massacre’s increased additional attack range will boost his reach as he’s wailing on his foes.
				
				Q - Dark Flight
				
					newDON’T STOP ME NOW Aatrox is now unstoppable during Dark Flight’s descent
				
				R - Massacre
				
					ADDITIONAL ATTACK RANGE 175 ⇒ 225
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Caitlyn
				Previous attack speed changes reverted. Reduced trap uptime and vision, but procs deal more damage later. Less health early. Headshot can proc on turrets.
				
					Caitlyn’s received several rounds of changes targeted at the late-game effectiveness of her basic attacks. These passes succeeded in knocking Caitlyn out of must-pick status, but netted more cost than benefit since her basic attack feels far worse to use as a result. This isn’t to say all marksman basics should feel the same, or that it’s impossible for a marksman to succeed at lower attack speed thresholds... just that Caitlyn in particular has fallen below the bar of where she should be.
					So, we’re restoring most of what we took from Caitlyn earlier in the season and carving out a more exploitable early-game weakness instead. She still has plenty of tools to bully enemies in lane, but her reduced base health gives opponents a more realistic chance of beating her if they can force favorable trades and all-ins. At the same time, Cait needs to secure early leads more than ever. Her damage is more item-dependent than before, and her general utility of creating excessive safety by blocking off lanes and gank paths has been brought down to far more reasonable levels. All in all, the Sheriff of Piltover’s back to being a late-game demon, but she’ll have to play more carefully as she walks the path to get there.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE HEALTH 524.4 ⇒ 475
				
				
					HEALTH GROWTH STAT 80 ⇒ 85
				
				
					BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.543 ⇒ 0.568

				Janna
				E cooldown increased at early ranks. Janna’s basic attacks are stronger. Q base range increased; moves faster when charged.
				
					This is a big set of changes which, combined with the Ardent Censer changes below, add up to say “Janna isn’t a shield bot in lane anymore.” Most directly, eight extra seconds on Eye of the Storm’s rank 1 cooldown makes choosing when to shield a decision with real consequences if Janna chooses wrong. From there, we’re teasing out a more aggressive, risk-taking playstyle from the rest of her kit. Many of these changes read oddly in a vacuum, so go through ‘em with this in mind: a Janna who’s hitting you with attacks and abilities is a Janna who’s standing in threat range with her defensive tools on cooldown.
					Putting all the pieces together, 7.19 is a net power-down for Janna (and we’re prepared to take further action to ensure that’s the case). Die-hard veterans will find success as they navigate her new risks and rewards, but bandwagoners will be staring at significantly grayer screens.

				Malphite
				W passive bonus armor is now tripled when Granite Shield is active.
				
					Malphite is falling a tad short in his role as an anti-physical tank, so we want to give him the opportunity to play his strengths in a way that's tied to his identity. Now, there's an opportunity for Malphite to play around his passive more often, as items like Thornmail and Iceborn Gauntlet get even more powerful when his passive is up. This will also give his opponents something to pay attention to when playing against him. #Counterplay

				Orianna
				Q ball travelling speed increased. W and R will fire only when the ball stops moving.
				
					We're happy with Orianna's reliability and skill timings, but we want to make it more clear and understandable to her enemies when her skills will happen. It’s important to note that if W and R are buffered during the ball’s travel time, only the last cast will occur when the ball arrives its destination.

				Vayne
				Q bonus damage increased, but no longer benefits from critical strike. R now extends duration when a target Vayne has damage in the last 3 seconds dies.
				
					Vayne is at a pretty decent place for most players: she has clearly defined weaknesses - her weak laning phase - but if she makes it out unscathed, her high damage output and slippery nature can take over games. But at the highest levels of play, she is more consistently punished for her weaknesses, and never really gets to shine. We think intense high moments and notable low moments is also a part of Vayne’s outplay fantasy, however, so we want to make sure we preserve that feeling, even as we’re making her laning phase more survivable. As a result, let’s break this changelist down into two separate points.
					Primarily, we’re shifting some of Vayne’s power back into her laning phase, at the expense of some of her late-game crit scaling. To make sure her potential for high moments is still there, we’re adding a new mechanic to Final Hour to let her snowball a teamfight when she starts off on the right foot.
				
				Q - Tumble
				
					newTRIP NOT CRIT Bonus damage is no longer increased when the attack critically strikes
				
				
					DAMAGE 30/35/40/45/50% of total Attack Damage ⇒ 50/55/60/65/70% of total Attack Damage

					MINIMUM DAMAGE 40/60/80/100/120 ⇒ 50/65/80/95/110
				
				R - Final Hour
				
					newONE MORE TURN If a champion dies within 3 seconds of being damaged by Vayne, Final Hour’s duration is extended by 4 seconds. This cannot extend the remaining duration past the initial maximum duration.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Veigar
				Base health, health regen, and health regen growth increased. W cooldown reduced.
				
					Veigar’s infinitely-scaling mage fantasy is exciting in theory, but he currently has too many pronounced weaknesses hampering him from reaching his immense power. On the one hand, his weak laning phase prevents him from getting there, and on the other hand, his late game power is coming up a bit...well, short.
					In lane, the unreliability of Dark Matter without Event Horizon makes trading pretty rough unless Veigar is willing to burn a ton of mana. Coupled with his low health and health regen, pushing him out of lane was a pretty trivial task. His trading still won’t be great after these changes, but he should be less free to bully around.
					In the late game, the Tiny Master of Evil’s unlimited power fantasy is heavily countered by Banshee’s Veil and Quicksilver Sash. Since Dark Matter is already hard to land, we want to give him more chances to land it, especially when he’s scaling hard.
				
				Base stats
				
					ATTACK RANGE 525 ⇒ 550
				
				
					BASE HEALTH REGEN 5.42 ⇒ 6.5
				
				
					HEALTH REGEN GROWTH STAT 0.55 ⇒ 0.6

	Items
	
		
			
				
				Ardent Censer
				Ardent Censer’s buff no longer restores health. The buff’s attack speed and damage scale with level again. Censer’s owner now also gets buffed when its user heals or shields an ally.
				
					What we like about Ardent Censer: it gives Enchanters a way to spec into offense, versus defensive builds around Locket, . What we don’t like: it’s relegating supports to heal/shield batteries and acting as a lifesteal item for carries, meaning they aren’t forced to make itemization tradeoffs between sustain and damage. Crit builds just get to have both. More than “Censer OP”, this is a problem with the item’s design. Solving that problem means significant shifts in the support landscape, so in order to keep things stable for Worlds, we’ve avoided tackling that challenge until now.
					To wit, we’re replacing Ardent Censer’s on-hit heal with a duplicate buff for its wielder. This gives supports a way to participate in Censer’s offensive game plan while removing its function as a proxy sustain item for carries. Aggressive enchanters will still find success with the item, but those who prefer more defensive playstyles should look for greener pastures.
				
				
					newSAME Healing or shielding an allied champion now also grants you Ardent Censer’s buff, instead of only your ally
				
				
					removedON-HIT HEAL Ardent Censer’s buff no longer restores health
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED 25% ⇒ 20-35% (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					ON-HIT DAMAGE 25 ⇒ 20-35 (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Bramble Vest
				Cost increased. Damage reflected decreased.
				
					Bramble Vest was a much needed item for tanks who desired a way to deal with auto-attackers with heavy lifesteal/healing. Right now, however, it’s overtuned to the point that it’s good against all basic attackers, so we’re bringing its cost up and effectiveness down a bit.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 900 gold ⇒ 1000 gold
				
				
					COMBINE COST 300 gold ⇒ 400 gold
				
				
					DAMAGE REFLECTED 20 ⇒ 15
				
				
					BUGFIX No longer applies Grievous Wounds to non-Champions
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Thornmail
				Armor increased
				
					Thanks to Bramble Vest’s efficiency, Thornmail had an amazing build path. With that build path getting weakened, we want to put more stats into Thornmail to ensure it remains a worthwhile upgrade.
				
				
					ARMOR 75 ⇒ 80
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Edge of Night
				Spellshield duration increased. Cooldown decreased.
				
					When compared to other lethality items, or even other defensive AD options (Guardian Angel, Maw of Malmortius), Edge of Night is lagging behind. We want it to be an item that's at least considered alongside the others, so we're amping up its unique strengths to be a bit easier to use on a more frequent basis.
				
				
					SPELLSHIELD DURATION 5 seconds ⇒ 7 seconds
				
				
					ACTIVE COOLDOWN 45 seconds ⇒ 40 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Righteous Glory
				Combine and total cost increased.
				
					Historically, it’s been a concern whenever an initiation item is cost-effective as a rush item, because it allows a team which is ahead to force fights and get more ahead. Righteous Glory is starting to hit that point, so we’re bringing its price point up slightly to make it less efficient and come slightly later in the game.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2500 gold ⇒ 2650 gold
				
				
					COMBINE COST 950 gold ⇒ 1100 gold
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zeke's Convergence
				Burn damage more frontloaded. Frostfire Covenant now procs when the passive slow is applied.
				
					Zeke’s is both undertuned compared to its competition, and its unique buddy-system playstyle is difficult to optimize. For many of the tanky champions we’d like to see pick up Zeke’s, the basic attack procs of Frostfire Covenant are difficult to execute due to its positioning demands. We’re making the trigger more approachable by simply requiring supports to be in slowing range of their bonded ally’s target, rather than nearly on top of them. We’re also further frontloading the burn damage on ally basic attacks, which will increase the damage dealt by frequent application.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2400 ⇒ 2250
				
				
					COMBINE COST 400 ⇒ 250
				
				Ally burn damage
				
					updatedFRONTLOADED Up-front damage increased from 17.5% of the basic attack’s damage ⇒ 25% of the basic attack’s damage
				
				
					TOTAL BURN DAMAGE STILL 50% of basic attack
				
				Frostfire Covenant
				
					updatedSLOW BURN Frost storm no longer ignites from basic attacking a burning enemy, now ignites when it slows a burning enemy.

	Spell Shields
	
		
			
				
					This one’s been a long time coming. Ever since League was created, spell shields have been set up to block every ability that hits within an instant of the shield popping. This was due to a code limitation that prevented spell shields from properly ‘talking to’ enemy abilities.
					They now work as advertised: only one spell gets blocked, even if the shielded champion is hit near-simultaneously by multiple abilities at once. This won’t come up as often as you might think (the window of protection was seriously tiny), but the more you know… or something.
				
				
					SPAGHETTI STRAIGHTENED Spell shields now block only the first ability that hits, rather than every ability that hits at the same time the shield is broken

					We also updated the game mode with new features and some bug fixes.

				Xayah, Rakan, Kayn, and Ornn now playable in Nexus Siege
					Kayn tip: You can Shadow Step through walls into the back of the enemy spawn pad, but we don’t recommend it because laz0rz.

Welcome to a new patch, team!Worlds is coming up, so none of these changes are particularly aggressive, but we do want to make sure that some of the dominant outliers get tapped down a bit, and some popular picks who have fallen out of favor see some love. Because the stability of this patch is so important, we’re holding back on deeper changes that we’re still investigating, but we’ll be revisiting those champions and items in future patches.We’re also looking at Ornn. We micropatched Ornn twice last patch, and he’s still struggling. We don’t want to overbuff him, so are primarily focusing on his usability, but we’re still monitoring player performance as prospective Ornn mains progress up the mastery curve.See you on the Rift,

Champions
Azir
R base damage increased
As a fragile damage dealer, Azir subjects himself to a ton of risk in the late game when attempting flashy ult plays against the enemy backline. His reward for landing those late-game shuffles should be worthy of that risk.On a forward-facing note, expect to hear a lot more about Azir in the near future. We’ll keep you posted!

Cassiopeia
E bonus against poisoned targets shifted from base damage into ratio.
Twin Fang’s high base damage is allowing Cassiopeia to dip into defensive itemization while still pumping out glass-cannon-level damage in the early-to-mid game. If Cass wants to melt face, she should have to (literally) pay for it.

Elise
W base damage decreased but scaling increased. E cooldown increased at later ranks.
Elise is the premiere magic damage jungler at the moment, especially in pro play. She’s perfect for snowballing the early game, but teams that fail to do so aren’t paying a cost later on. Reducing Elise’s access to Rappel in the late game reduces the baseline contributions she makes to her team (baiting enemy cooldowns) and leaves her vulnerable for longer stretches of time. As a result, she’ll have to capitalize more heavily on her early advantages to impact (and survive) teamfights. On the same note, taking some of the bite away from Volatile Spiderling’s base damage forces Elise to reach higher AP thresholds to deal the same damage late game, which is only feasible in matches where she’s built up a gold advantage.

Fiora
Passive’s movement speed increased. Ultimate now grants passive’s movement speed within its area.
Back in patch 7.14 we made some changes to curb some of Fiora’s mobility, but those nerfs coincided with shifts in the meta to leave the Grand Duelist in a rough spot. In a world where Bramble Vest didn’t exist, forcing Fiora to work reach her enemies—and stick to them—made sense. In a world with Bramble Vest, however, Fiora’s dealing less damage (opponents have more armor) and sustaining less off Vital procs (Bramble Vest’s Grievous Wounds), so that handicap no longer makes sense. We’re reverting 7.14’s mobility nerfs and will keep an eye on Fiora.

Gnar
Mini Gnar’s base health decreased.
Gnar's back at the top of top lane again. While we're glad he’s pushing tanks when they can’t get to him, we want to give opponents a better chance to go for the kill when they do capitalize on his positioning mistakes.

Gragas

Gragas is a very consistent, safe jungler who just does everything well. We want to remove some consistency, so we’re making his clear a bit less healthy and making Body Slam more fair for opponents to dodge.

Ivern
E explosion base damage and ratio increased.
Triggerseed has seen several nerfs this season, but the last set of changes came alongside a weakening of the support items which also contributed to Ivern’s dominance. The double nerf left Ivern a bit undertuned, so we’re giving back the damage we took from Triggerseed in the last go-around (though part of it’s in the ratio now).

Jarvan IV
W base shield and shield per enemy champion decreased.
At present, the Prince of Demacia is dunking enemy backlines and tanking everything the enemy team throws at him in the process. We're toning down his durability so diving the squishies is more of a daunting task.

Kalista
R cooldown increased.
Kalista’s kit lends itself well to coordinated teams, so it’s not surprising to see her at the top of the competitive scene’s pick/ban charts without similarly dominating regular matches. We’re tapping down the frequency of her Fate’s Call plays to reduce her presence in the pro scene, leaving her less team-dependent strengths intact for everyone else.

R - Fate's Call

Lee Sin
W shield increased at early ranks, decreased at rank 5.
With no hard crowd control in the early game, we want to make sure Lee Sin brings best-in-class 2v2 dueling power. We’re buffing up Safeguard’s early shield to make The Blind Monk’s perfectly-played ganks even more impactful.

W - Safeguard

Lucian
E cooldown increased at early ranks.
Lucian’s risen to prominence as the go-to midlane bully. We’re increasing the windows of vulnerability he incurs by burning Relentless Pursuit offensively: if Lucian wants to dash into danger, he’ll have to shoot his way back out of it.

E - Relentless Pursuit

Nautilus
Q mana cost no longer increases with rank-up. Q now refunds half of its mana cost when it hits terrain.
Dredge Line eats a lot of mana, meaning Nautilus either drains the tank pretty quickly when trying to make plays or gives up pressure to conserve his resources. We’re letting Naut cram more Q casts into his mana bar to encourage anchor tossing, potentially even opening the door to earlier Dredge Line maxes for Nautilii who want to prioritize engaging for their team.

Nidalee
E heal ratio increased.
Nidalee’s been out of the spotlight for a while, and even when teams would benefit from a magic damage jungler they’re often overlooking her entirely. Her clears are still some of the quickest in the game and she deals plenty of damage, but she lacks some of the utility other junglers bring. We’re strengthening her healing as she scales into the late game to even the playing field.

Ornn
New Forge Item: Zhonya’s Paradox. First Ram’s maximum speed increased. 
Ornn’s been suffering pretty harshly since his release, moreso than other new champions. Among other changes, several of our mid-patch updates focused on getting his abilities to flow more easily. We’re continuing that work with 7.18. First, we’re preventing Ornn’s teammates from hamstringing themselves by rushing his Masterwork upgrades. Ornn’s Forge items are meant to be something special for the late game, not early-game power spikes. Second, we’re making Call of the Forge God easier to use by giving opponents less time to react to it.

Rakan
W dash speed decreased late game. R radius decreased, and cooldown decreased late game.
Rakan has too much reliability in his engage pattern, especially once he gets boots and pops The Quickness or other movement speed buffs. We’re toning down how quickly Grand Entrance gets him into the thick of things to give opponents more time to react. Also, we’re dialing back how easily Rakan can hit multiple targets with The Quickness, to make him earn those fat engages.

Rengar
Base armor increased.
When Rengar was at his peak, he was able to consistently one-shot squishies. Now that there are more viable tank-support items that allow supports to mitigate burst (Knight’s Vow, for example) there’s less risk of Rengar running away with a game without being fed. As a result, it’s safer to let him get to the mid-game more consistently, so we’re making his early clear less rough.

Ryze
W ratio increased.
Ryze has been in a pretty weak place for a while. We don’t want to make it any easier for him to reach his strong late game, but we think he could use a bit more damage in his combo once he’s started to really build ability power. 

W - Rune Prison

Spellthief's Edge Line
Frostfang now has cooldown reduction, Frost Queen’s Claim build path adjusted to compensate. Tribute lockout for last-hitting a minion increased.
We haven’t seen much of the Spellthief’s line since we made Ancient Coin an actually-appealing item earlier in the season. This is less about Coin and more about Spellthief’s: the line just isn’t doing its job of enabling early aggression. We’re moving the cooldown reduction of Frostfang’s upgrades onto Frostfang itself, making it a more potent laning threat. This has the side effect of unlocking more build flexibility: sitting on Frostfang in the midgame will be less punishing for supports who’d rather start building into their late-game oriented items.That said, the Spellthief’s line has historically been vulnerable to midlane poaching when strong. We’re upping the Tribute penalty for last-hitting to nip that problem in the bud.

Gargoyle Stoneplate
Health granted by Stoneplate's active's is now partially base health, rather than entirely bonus health.
Making good on last patch’s promise, we’ve got a set of changes to mitigate Stoneplate’s oversynergies with a few specific effects. Most importantly, Stoneplate now knows the difference between base health and bonus health. The total health granted is the same as before (with two exceptions—see below), but Stoneplate will contribute far less to effects that scale with bonus health as a result of this change—Cho’Gath’s ult and Locket’s shield being the two most notorious offenders here.Also, last patch’s Cinderhulk bugfix is back now that Kled isn’t freaking out about it.

BUGFIX
(Re-)fixed a bugged interaction between Cinderhulk and Gargoyle Stoneplate's active which caused the combination to grant more bonus health than intended




Knight's Vow
Cost decreased. Health decreased.
Support items are at a lower price point than other tank items, so we can make them very gold efficient without making them appealing to other classes. In Knight’s Vow’s case, the overall stats on the item were high enough to still entice more farmed tanks, so we’re toning that efficiency down. By bringing the price point and the stats down, we can make Knight’s Vow more clearly a low-budget item that’s focused on it’s unique effects.

		Welcome to a new patch, team!
		Continuing recent trends, 7.17’s light on the balance front, but you’d be hard-pressed to call this patch “small” considering everything else going on! Ornn’s emerging from centuries of solitude (sort of… he is a toplaner, after all), and five new Star Guardians hit the Rift Valoran Park. Not sure where Valoran Park is? Sit tight for Invasion, League’s latest game mode. This patch also brings a sweet improvement to item sets—you can finally pre-select which slots your items go in when you pick ‘em up!
		Quick housekeeping note: 7.17’s gonna be a longer patch than usual, so tack some extra days onto your expectations around the usual “during this patch”-esque comments below. The next set of notes will be for the patch we plan to host Worlds on.
		Best of luck in your matches, friends.

				Draven
				Passive grants less base gold; Draven loses more stacks on death.
				
					While lane bullying is core to who Draven is, that power comes with the promise that enemies can stop him from scaling into mid- and late- game if they shut him down early. (Draven must leave lane with more levels and items than his opponents if he wants to be useful in teamfights.) At present, that promise isn’t being met. Unless teams chain-gank the Glorious Executioner into the dirt, a stray death here or there just isn’t enough to stop Draven’s (bank)roll. We’re steepening the Adoration penalty incurred on death and reducing the amount of free gold Draven gets for putting axes into foes' backs.
				
				Passive - League of Draven
				
					ADORATION STACKS LOST ON DEATH 50% ⇒ 75%
				
				
					BASE GOLD ON CHAMPION KILL 50 ⇒ 25
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ezreal
				Q ratio increased.
				
					Considering the current enchanter meta in botlane, it's understandable why Ezreal isn’t excelling. Whenever he manages to poke, he’s quickly countered by either a shield or a heal. So, we looked for spaces to give Ez a chance to do things that make his mahou* power more impactful. Due to the long range, low cooldown, and low mana cost on Mystic Shot, Ez gets to harass people during early laning phase. As the game progresses and his enemies’ abilities come online, he becomes less of a threat. Ezreal’s itemization factors into this as well. His unique item power spike comes when his Tear’s fully stacked and Muramana is completed—usually around the same time he finishes Trinity Force, meaning the two combine into one huge damage boost. We really like this pattern for Ez, so we're letting him capitalize harder on both his early lane phase and double-item spike.(*Translator’s note: mahou means magical)
				
				Q - Mystic Shot
				
					RATIO 1.1 total attack damage ⇒ 1.25 total attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Hecarim
				E no longer ticks down during R’s charge. R fear duration now scales with distance traveled.
				
					As an undead rider, the idea of Hecarim riding his opponents down is quite compelling. At the moment, it’s very common for Hecarim to ride up to somebody, then ult from point-blank range, which just doesn’t feel very horsey. To give him that good cavalry feel, we’re tweaking his ultimate—and the way it interacts with Devastating Charge—so he can feel better about aggressive, long-range engagements.
				
				E - Devastating Charge
				
					newCAN’T STOP WON’T STOP Duration no longer ticks down during Onslaught of Shadow's charge
				
				R - Onslaught of Shadows
				
					FEAR DURATION 1 second ⇒ 0.75 - 1.5 seconds (based on how far Hecarim traveled with his Spectral Riders)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Leona
				Passive mark expires faster but deals more damage when proc’d. Q cooldown decreased at early ranks, increased at rank 5.
				
					While Leona’s always been a powerhouse in regular play, she’s historically struggled to leave a dent at the top of League’s ladder. Our goal this patch is to give Leona power that plays best in the hands of more skilled players. Sunlight’s contributions are up for synchronized duos who proc it as it’s applied, but those procs are now less of a given if Leona and her carry aren’t acting in lock-step. Shield of Daybreak’s cooldown adjustment gives Leona more ways to help her team in early skirmishes where she’s otherwise left flailing her sword for ages after initiating the fight.
				
				Passive - Sunlight
				
					MARK DURATION 3.5 seconds ⇒ 1.5 seconds
				
				
					DAMAGE 20-105 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 25-144 (at levels 1-18)

					COOLDOWN 9/8/7/6/5 seconds ⇒ 6 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Maokai
				Passive can no longer proc off of wards.
				
					Maokai missed last patch’s work to standardize on-hit interactions with wards, so this change is basically playing catch-up.
				
				Passive - Sap Magic
				
					WARDS AREN’T PEOPLE Sap Magic no longer procs when Maokai attacks a ward
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Urgot
				R slow duration and reactivation window increased. W lockout after failing to hit a champion with E reduced, W locked on debuff now refreshes with W hits.
				
					Unfortunately the buff dude with the sick shotgun knees is struggling a little. To help him out, we’re allowing Urgot more time to drop his prey to Fear Beyond Death’s execution threshold, making the meat grinding that follows a more reliable spectacle. We’re also fixing some of the bugs and interactions around Purge and Disdain, making Urgot behave a little more like you’d expect him to when he’s locked on and blasting his enemies.
				
				W - Purge
				
					STAY FOCUSED Purge now refreshes the duration of the ‘locked on’ debuff, preventing cases where Urgot would switch targets partway through Purge’s duration
				
				E - Disdain
				
					QUICK RECOVERY If Urgot casts Disdain during Purge but fails to toss a champion, Purge will now resume firing for the remainder of its duration a bit earlier than before (lockout period reduced to ~1.375 seconds ⇒ 1 second)
				
				R - Fear Beyond Death
				
					SLOW DURATION & REACTIVATION WINDOW 3 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zed
				Base attack speed increased. W shadow duration increased.
				
					Zed could be a little bit stronger right now, but we believe his burst damage is at a pretty sweet spot already. So instead, we're giving the Master of Shadows more opportunities to out-maneuver his opponents and use Living Shadow to do more ninja stuff. This helps Zed control minion waves, split push, and find more windows to use his abilities more aggressively.
				
				Base Stats
				
					BASE ATTACK SPEED 0.644 ⇒ 0.651
				
				W - Living Shadow
				
					SHADOW DURATION 4.5 seconds ⇒ 5 seconds

				Ardent Censer
				Attack speed buff and health drain buff decreased.
				
					Ardent Censer already offers a lot of power as a rush item: attack speed and lifesteal for carries who are still building their multiplicative items. It doesn’t need to scale nearly so well into the late game on top of that.
				
				
					ATTACK SPEED BUFF 20-35% ⇒ 25%
				
				
					HEALTH DRAIN BUFF 20-35 ⇒ 25
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Gargoyle Stoneplate
				
					Stoneplate’s introduction earlier in the season gave tanks a powerful tool to double down on their teamfight survivability. That said, we need to clear up a few problem cases if we want it to stick around for the long term. This patch addresses a bugged interaction with Cinderhulk, whose bonus health modifier was double-dipping to make Stoneplate’s active stronger than intended. This in turn affects stuff like Cho’Gath’s ult and Locket of the Iron Solari’s shield, hence us pulling the fix up into its own section. One bugfix isn’t the end of the script, though—expect further changes within the next few patches.
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where the Metallicize active forgot to remove Cinderhulk’s +20% bonus health multiplier when calculating its health increase. Cinderhulk’s multiplier always applies after all other health-modifying effects, meaning Metallicize was benefitting more than it should have.
				
				
					SO MUCH MATH For example, at 1000 bonus health, the combination of Cinderhulk + Stoneplate was granting 1640 additional bonus health instead of 1400 with three or more enemies nearby. (These numbers don't take base health into account since that portion of Stoneplate's bonus wasn't bugged.)

		Got patching problems? Check the Boards for tips and solutions!
	


	
		Hey there, friends!
		As we approach Worlds, our changes lean a little bit more on tweaks to make high competitive play more balanced. Along with several mid-laners getting changed, we have some other stuff such as Cinderhulk and the Ancient Coin line.
		Also, ARURF is making an extended comeback, so watch out for carpal tunnel.
		Bam, ultra rapid foreword. We’ll see you on the Rift.

	Champions
	
		
			
				
				Caitlyn
				Q deals less damage to targets beyond the first. W base damage decreased at early ranks; ratio reduced.
				
					While recent changes to Caitlyn have focused on her late-game teamfighting* (headshots and traps), this patch is about how the Sheriff gets there. Cait’s historically had a rocky mid-game: her early strength wanes as lane phase ends, but she doesn’t hit carry status for another few thousand gold’s worth of items after that. That mid-game lull was largely erased when we smoothed out marksman item progression. We’re re-establishing it by tapping down her effectiveness prior to completing multiple end-game items.
					*Sidenote: even accounting for their role as Caitlyn’s ideal teamfight contributions, trap procs were hitting slightly too hard in the late-game. Hence, a flat ratio nerf.
				
				Q - Piltover Peacemaker
				
					PASSTHROUGH DAMAGE 67% to enemies beyond the first ⇒ 50% to enemies beyond the first
				
				W - Yordle Snap Trap
				
					TRAP BONUS DAMAGE 30/70/110/150/190 (+0.7 total attack damage) ⇒ 10/55/100/145/190 (+0.6 total attack damage)
				
				
					TOOLTIP FIX Yordle Snap Trap’s tooltip now displays the correct root duration of 1.5 seconds (actual duration unchanged)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Fiora
				Duelist’s Dance bonus movement speed increased at later ranks of Grand Challenge.
				
					Back in 7.14 we gave Fiora’s opponents better opportunity to both retaliate as she aimed to pierce their vitals, and out-maneuver the Grand Duelist during Grand Challenge. Removing Grand Challenge’s free movement speed had the desired effect, but the hit to Duelist’s Dance left Fiora less nimble than we’d like. We’re pulling back a bit on the changes to her passive in response.
				
				Passive - Duelist's Dance
				
					BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED 15/20/25/30% ⇒ 15/25/35/45%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kayn
				
					More bugfixin’.
				
				Passive - The Darkin Scythe
				
					BUGFIX Kayn no longer gains transformation progress from ticks of Corrupting Potion, Deathfire Touch, Red Buff, or Challenging Smite. (Other periodic effects, such as Ignite, already had no impact on transformation progress.)
				
				W - Blade's Reach
				
					TOOLTIP FIX Shadow Assassin Kayn’s tooltip for Blade’s Reach now displays the proper slow duration, slow value, and bonus attack damage ratio. In-game effects are unchanged.
				
				R - Umbral Trespass
				
					BUGFIX-FIX Kayn once again marks targets for R - Umbral Trespass, even when his damage is completely absorbed by a shield
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Maokai
				Sapling Toss damage down at early ranks.
				
					The Twisted Treant is simply performing too well in both the jungle and top lane. Currently Sapling Toss is both an excellent one-point-wonder and a totally lackluster option to rank up. We’re lowering its single-rank damage but preserving its maxed-out strength, giving Maokai the option to max E for super-effective saplings while making him easier to bear until that point.
				
				E - Sapling Toss
				
					MAX HEALTH DAMAGE 8% target’s maximum health at all ranks ⇒ 6/6.5/7/7.5/8% target’s maximum health
				
				
					BRUSH SAPLING MAX HEALTH DAMAGE 16% target’s maximum health at all ranks ⇒ 12/13/14/15/16% target’s maximum health
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Sion
				W grants more health for killing small units. R’s max damage increased.
				
					Sion never truly recovered from midseason’s durability item changes. Through this lens, giving him the means to win back some late-game tankiness is fairly straightforward. Past that, we’re packing more punch into Unstoppable Onslaught to bring Sion’s teamfight initiation up to a more appropriately threatening level.
				
				W - Soul Furnace
				
					BONUS HEALTH PER SMALL UNIT KILLED 2 ⇒ 3
				
				
					BONUS HEALTH PER LARGE UNIT KILLED 10 (unchanged)
				
				R - Unstoppable Onslaught
				
					MINIMUM DAMAGE 150/300/450 (unchanged)
				
				
					MAXIMUM DAMAGE 300/600/900 ⇒ 400/800/1200
				
				
					BUGFIX Sion is now properly immune to Lulu's W - Polymorph during Unstoppable Onslaught
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Vi
				R cooldown decreased. E attack can’t be canceled.
				
					Vi’s calling card is reliably singling out a priority target with Assault and Battery, then punching everyone around her into the dirt. We’d like to see her flex that strength more frequently as a single-target-lockdown champ in today’s jungle meta of AoE-disruption tanks and lethality-wielding assassins. As a separate feels-good change, we’re also making it easier for Vi to properly weave Excessive Force between other actions without accidentally canceling her punch in the process.
				
				E - Excessive Force
				
					COMMITMENT Excessive Force’s empowered attack can no longer be canceled after Vi begins winding up
				
				R - Assault and Battery
				
					COOLDOWN 150/115/80 seconds ⇒ 130/100/70 seconds
				
				
					BUGFIX Vi once again ends up a short distance behind her target
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				On-Hit Interactions With Wards
				
					It makes sense for attack reset abilities (ex. Blitzcrank’s E - Power Fist) to consume their on-hit effects when used on wards: you’re choosing to burn a cooldown to play the vision game. But you can’t choose not to use a stack- or timer-based proc (ex. Caitlyn’s Passive - Headshot) when it’s up - you’re just forced to pay an extra cost to play the vision game. This is more ‘uncontrollable punishment’ than ‘interesting tradeoff’, so we generally avoid having these effects be consumed against wards. The changes below bring a few abilities in line with this thinking.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Aatrox
				W third-hit effects no longer proc against wards.
				
					Changing Blood Thirst / Blood Price to be consistent with the on-hit context above, though Aatrox comes with a few extra considerations. The Darkin Blade benefitted from his on-hit bonuses proccing on wards: Thirst is a heal and Price stacks the Blood Well. We discussed special-casing Aatrox to let W continue proccing on wards, but came up against another issue. We removed the ability to lifesteal off wards during preseason, and Blood Thirst’s heal is inconsistent with that change. This shifted the scales back toward standardizing W’s interaction with wards. While the loss of situational utility stings, it shouldn’t critically impact Aatrox’s strength since he can’t control when he has an enemy ward to attack.
				
				W - Blood Thirst / Blood Price
				
					WARDS AREN’T PEOPLE Blood Thirst / Blood Price’s on-hit effects no longer proc against wards
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jax
				R third-attack effect no longer procs against wards.
				
					Changing Grandmaster’s Might to be consistent with the on-hit context above.
				
				R - Grandmaster's Might
				
					WARDS AREN’T PEOPLE Grandmaster’s Might’s on-hit bonus damage no longer procs against wards
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jayce
				Transform on-hit effects no longer proc against wards.
				
					Changing Mercury Cannon / Mercury Hammer’s transform bonuses to be consistent with the on-hit context above.
				
				R - Mercury Cannon / Mercury Hammer
				
					WARDS AREN’T PEOPLE Jayce’s on-hit bonus effects upon switching stances no longer proc against wards
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Riven
				Passive stacks no longer proc against wards.
				
					Changing Runic Blade to be consistent with the on-hit context above.
				
				Passive - Runic Blade
				
					WARDS AREN’T PEOPLE Runic Blade charges no longer proc against wards

	Mid-Lane Worlds Balance
	
		
			
				
					We’re fast approaching the Worlds patch! (7.18, for reference.) Last patch marked the start of our preparation with light changes to 20-some champions across many positions and roles. That work continues with 7.16, and while a number of changes above fall into the Worlds prep bucket as well, we’re paying particular attention to mid lane today. It’s important to note that if we only tweaked the absolute top picks, others would soon raise as top contenders - keep that in mind if any of the names below seem to be coming out of left field. You can get the context for each champion individually below, but we wanted to let you know why we changed a bunch of mages (and Fizz) at the same time.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Cassiopeia
				Mana per level increased. E base damage down, AP ratio increased.
				
					Cassiopeia is known and picked for her ability to control her lane very well during early levels. We’re okay with her having some early kill pressure, but opting into the level 1 non-empowered “E-spam” strategy shouldn’t automatically win the lane.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE MANA 375 ⇒ 334
				
				
					MANA GROWTH STAT 60 ⇒ 63
				
				E - Twin Fang
				
					DAMAGE VS POISONED TARGETS 10/40/70/100/130 (+0.35 ability power) ⇒ 15/40/65/90/115 (+0.4 ability power)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Corki
				Base attack damage decreased.
				
					Now that Corki scales better into the late game with magic penetration, he doesn’t need to have such a strong early game.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 58 ⇒ 55
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Fizz
				E cooldown decreased.
				
					When facing the enemies Fizz should excel against during early laning phase, the nimble Trickster is not faring so well so we’re giving him a bit of power in that front.
				
				E - Playful / Trickster
				
					COOLDOWN 18/16/14/12/10 seconds ⇒ 16/14.5/13/11.5/10 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Galio
				R cooldown increased at earlier ranks; R ally damage reduction reduced at later ranks
				
					When teams can coordinate around Hero's Entrance (hello pro players), Galio’s playmaking becomes too consistent and too strong. We're toning the how much he gets to do it on early game, along with his ability to make allies unkillable as the game goes on.
				
				R - Hero's Entrance
				
					COOLDOWN 160/140/120 seconds ⇒ 180/150/120 seconds
				
				
					ALLY DAMAGE REDUCTION 20/30/40% ⇒ 20/25/30%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				LeBlanc
				Q damage against minions decreased.
				
					While there’s more comprehensive work to be done on LeBlanc, doing so this close to Worlds risks destabilizing the entire tournament. We have plans to revisit her later on but right now, we want to tackle her how much her wave-clear gives her room to roam. The Deceiver can burst entire minion waves using Shatter Orb passive, giving her the freedom to pay a visit to other lanes or Chain her combos (heh) on her laning opponent since there are no minions around to block Ethereal Chain.
				
				Q - Shatter Orb
				
					MINION DAMAGE 80% ⇒ 60%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Orianna
				W base damage decreased, buffer range with Q decreased. E shield decreased.
				
					Orianna's strong laning phase and mid-game trades make her the best option when compared to other generalist mages. We want her to be picked for her unique properties rather than because she can brute-force everybody out through trades.
				
				W - Command: Dissonance
				
					BASE DAMAGE 70/115/160/205/250 ⇒ 60/105/150/195/240
				
				
                    
                    BUFFERED CAST RANGE While The Ball is moving from Q - Command: Attack, queued-up Command: Dissonance casts will fire at Q's target location once The Ball is 275 ⇒ 75 units away from Q's target location.
                
                
                    WHAT? Command: Dissonance won't fire at a wildly misleading distance away from The Ball
                


				E - Command: Protect
				
					BASE SHIELD 80/120/160/200/240 ⇒ 60/100/140/180/220
				
				
					GAME-BREAKING BUG E’s damage is unchanged, so the “75%” figure written in the tooltip is incorrect. Trust the actual damage values listed!
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Syndra
				Q AP ratio reduced. E AP ratio increased.
				
					For someone with such high burst potential, Syndra deals a bit too much sustained damage.
				
				Q - Dark Sphere
				
					RATIO 0.75 ability power ⇒ 0.65 ability power
				
				E - Scatter the Weak
				
					RATIO 0.5 ability power ⇒ 0.6 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Taliyah
				Q mana cost increased.
				
					Taliyah often gets to push her opponents in lane freely, getting to itemize straight into raw damage instead of solving the mana issues her counterparts have to deal with.
				
				Q - Threaded Volley
				
					COST 50/55/60/65/70 mana ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100 mana
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Items
	
		
			
				
				Ancient Coin Line
				Mana coins restore less mana.
				
					We recently double-buffed the Ancient Coin line by increasing the gold and mana bonuses provided by coin drops, then reworking its quest reward the following patch. These changes left Coin too strong overall. We’re pulling back on the mana it provides so supports like Soraka and Sona aren’t able to keep their lane partners perpetually healthy.
				
				
					MANA COIN REWARD 15% missing mana ⇒ 10% missing mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Enchantment: Cinderhulk
				Combine cost up.
				
					As tanks continue their return to jungle prominence, we’ve been keeping an eye on Cinderhulk. The strength Cinderhulk offers isn’t off the mark, but it’s coming online a little too early, getting tank junglers rolling faster than their non-Cinderhulk competition. Delaying Cinderhulk by a camp or so is just enough of a push to get tank scaling to a similar pace as other junglers.
				
				
					COMBINE COST 525 gold (2425 total gold) ⇒ 600 gold (2500 total gold)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Duskblade of Draktharr
				
					Updated VFX to improve clarity

	Vision Ping
	
		
			
				
					This one is long coming, but we're happy to say the \"enemy vision here ping\" is finally here! The ping hasn’t yet been integrated into the ping wheel - we’re looking into solutions that don't result in the UI looking like a pizza - but the functionality has made it to live. No more allied jungler running straight past a ward on their way to try to gank your lane.
				
				
					newI CAN SEE YOU “Enemy ward here” has been added as a keybinding option in the “Communication” section of the in-game Hotkeys menu! (It’s not currently bindable through the client)
				
				
					BIND ME PLEASE “Enemy ward here” has no default keybinding so you’ll need to manually set one
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Skin Splash Portraits
	
		
			
				Your champion’s portrait in the HUD now uses your skin’s splash! (This is the big circle to the left of your abilities. Kill callouts, the minimap, etc. will still use base splashes for immediate recognizability.)
				Things affected:
				EVERY
					SINGLE
					SKIN

	In-Game Performance
	
		
			
				
					We've made a bunch of performance optimizations! You should experience better frame rates across the game, particularly during teamfights and around giant herds of minions. More improvements to come over the next few patches!
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Spectator Indicator Cleanup
	
		
			
				Cleaning house on some extraneous visuals (for Spectator only).
				
					While many UI indicators (the blue/red circles and lines) need to be super eye-grabbing for normal gameplay decisionmaking, a lot of them are adding too much visual noise for Spectator. This cleanup removes some of the less important ones.

	Rotating Game Mode
	
		
			
				
					All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF) is back from 8/11/17 12:00 PT to 8/24/17 11:59PM PT (Yes, the entire duration!) Enjoy superspeed cooldowns, infinite mana, blazing attack speeds, randomized champ select, and the return of Runeterra's most renowned manatee.
				   
					 
				
				
					Some things to note:
				
				Along with the points made above, we've also boosted gold gains, movement speed, and tenacity to keep things Rapid Fire.
					In this mode, you can spam the custom Urf emote, which replaces the Mastery emote.
					Rerolls are shared with ARAM, so using one in either mode consumes it in the other. To compensate, we’ve increased the rate you rack up rerolls for the weekend. You should stack a reroll every game or two depending on how many champs you have unlocked.
					Many non-ultimate shield scalings are down by 50%. Don't worry, shields are still awesome.
				
					Join in on the insanity and GLHF, URFers.

				Fixed a bug where Twitch's R - Spray and Pray dealt two instances of damage to inhibitors and the Nexus if he attacked from slightly outside his normal basic attack range
