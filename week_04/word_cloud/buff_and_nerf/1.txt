		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 8.10! Last time around, we revisited mana and waveclear; this patch we're checking out the jungle and rethinking the way we do kill streak bounties.
		First, the jungle. We've had to take efforts to dial back the amount of pressure junglers can exert early, but we're pushing that harder in the direction of the jungle camps. TL;DR, most jungle camps will be worth less experience early, but the Rift Scuttler will be worth a lot more. The jungler who can win the fight for River Crab—or sneak one when the other jungler can't respond—will be at an experience and sustain advantage, and can turn that into plays around the map.
		Next up, bounties. We've long cast bounties as a team objective: Kill the fed enemy for a boost of gold that can get your team back in the game. At the root of that is the ability to come back from a game that might otherwise snowball out of control. However, at the moment, spreading that reward to the whole team prevents individual players from feeling fully rewarded for their big plays.
		Finally, we're conducting a balance pass on non-keystone runes. The rune system has had some time to breathe (and adapt to new or changed keystones), so we're going through and tuning a number of the minor runes.
		GLHF,

	Champions
	
		
			
				
				Sion
				Base health regen decreased. E base damage decreased, damage ratio increased, and no longer deals bonus damage to secondary targets. E Armor shred now applies to secondary targets; duration increased.
				
					The bonus damage Sion does to secondary targets struck by Roar of the Slayer is just too much: too much waveclear, too much poke, too much long-ranged lane control. By having E apply the armor shred to all targets struck, Q damage will be higher on targets struck by E, and further incentivize him to max Q (or at least to ensure there are more tradeoffs when he does opt into the ranged control E offers).
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE HEALTH REGEN 10 per 5 seconds ⇒ 9 per 5 seconds
				
				E - Roar of the Slayer
				
					BASE DAMAGE 70/105/140/175/210 ⇒ 65/100/135/170/205
				
				
					ABILITY POWER RATIO 0.40 ability power ⇒ 0.55 ability power
				
				
					SECONDARY TARGET DAMAGE 130% ⇒ 100% to targets struck by a knocked-back enemy
				
				
					ARMOR REDUCTION 20% to primary target ⇒ 20% to all targets hit by Roar of the Slayer or a knocked-back enemy
				
				
					ARMOR REDUCTION DURATION 2.5 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
				
				R - Unstoppable Onslaught
				
					newCOMING THROUGH Sion's ultimate is no longer obstructed by an allied Azir's R - Emperor's Divide
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Dr. Mundo
				R cost and cooldown increased.
				
					Last patch's changes helped bring Mundo's ultimate to a more satisfying level of power, but decisions around when to invoke that power are a bit too forgiving. A longer cooldown and higher costs should make the timing of those choices more important.
				
				R - Sadism
				
					COOLDOWN 100/85/70 seconds ⇒ 110/100/90 seconds
				
				
					COST 20% current health ⇒ 25% current health
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Poppy
				Movement speed increased.
				
					Poppy’s changes last patch were intended to be approximately power neutral, but they ended up taking her down slightly. We're reverting the movement speed nerf to give Poppy more room to maneuver around fights (or just start them).
				
				Base stats
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 340 ⇒ 345
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zac
				W ability power ratio removed. E and R ability power damage ratio increased.
				
					Much like the Shyvana changes last patch, we want to make sure that damage-building Zac feels significantly different from tank Zac. While tank Zac has the durability to sit on his opponents' faces spamming W, a damage-oriented Zac can't survive that punishment as easily. Shifting his AP ratios out of W and onto his higher-impact abilities should ensure that when Zac does build damage, he feels like he was made for it, literally.
				
				W - Unstable Matter
				
					removedABILITY POWER RATIO No longer deals an additional 2% targets' max health per 100 ability power (base max health damage unchanged)
				
				E - Elastic Slingshot
				
					RATIO 0.70 ability power ⇒ 0.90 ability power
				
				R - Let's Bounce!
				
					RATIO 0.70 ability power ⇒ 0.90 ability power
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Bard
				W mana cost decreased.
				
					The high mana cost of Bard's W limits his uptime, especially in the laning phase. With a lower mana cost, he won't have to choose quite as directly between providing some healing to himself or his allies and having the mana to make plays on the map.
				
				W - Caretaker's Shrine
				
					COST 90 mana ⇒ 70 mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kindred
				
					Small quality of life buff.
				
				Passive - Mark of the Kindred
				
					newPACK HUNTER If an ally kills a hunted jungle monster within 6 seconds of Kindred damaging it, Kindred will still acquire the passive stack

				updated
				Runic Echoes
				Now builds out of Lost Chapter instead of Aether Wisp. Movement Speed removed. Cooldown reduction and Mana added.
				
					Mage junglers have been pretty scarce on the Rift for a while, and we're looking to change that. Changing Runic Echoes' buildpath to grant mana and cooldown reduction (both core mage stats) and increasing its overall stat efficiency should open the door for more mages to tango with jungle monsters.
					We've also made changes to Hunter's Talisman (check those out below) which should help spellcasters feel better about jungling even before they pick up Runic Echoes.
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2625 gold (unchanged)
				
				
					BUILD PATH Aether Wisp + Stalker's Blade + Amplifying Tome + 345 gold ⇒ Stalker's Blade + Lost Chapter + 325 gold
				
				
					removedMOVEMENT SPEED 7%
				
				
					newMANA 300
				
				
					newCOOLDOWN REDUCTION 10%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Warding Totem
				Wards last longer but have a higher cooldown.
				
					These changes increase the value of a well-placed ward, the cost of a bad one, and the payoff for successful ward-sweeping. Three birds, two stones!
				
				
					WARD DURATION 60-120 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 90-180 seconds (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					CHARGE TIMER 180-90 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 240-120 seconds (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Support & Jungle Item Exclusivity
				You can no longer have both a jungle item and a support item.
				
					Jungle items and gold items are both tuned to give unique, lower-cost power to their roles, which often operate on lower incomes than farming roles. We've had to combat the occasional cannibalization of support gold items by junglers, and at this point it's safer to just cut that option off.
				
				
					YOU MUST CHOOSE WISELY You can no longer own Hunter's Machete, Hunter's Talisman, or their upgrades at the same time as Ancient Coin, Spellthief's Edge, Relic Shield, or their upgrades

	Jungle
	
		
			
				
					
						Camp Experience
					Jungle monsters give less experience, but experience scales with level.
						
							Junglers have had too much of an impact in the early game. Specifically, they’ve too frequently been able to gank at level 3 before solo laners even reach that level. We’re looking to decrease consistent access to early jungle pressure but offer a more valuable Rift Scuttler as a new way for junglers to gain a lead.
						
						
							removedSLOW DOWN Experience no longer reduced by 5% per level champion is ahead of the camp being taken.
						
						
							newRAID BOSS Monster camp experience now scales with level, capping at level 7.

							SMALL RAZORBEAKS 35 ⇒ 19 - 30 (at levels 1-7)
						
						
							GROMP 200 ⇒ 115 - 180 (at levels 1-7)
						
						
							removedGRIMP Gromp no longer grants 37.5% reduced experience on its first clear
						
						
							removedFALSE START Medium Krugs, Small Krugs, and Large Razorbeak no longer grant 25% reduced experience on their first clear
						
						
							WHEATIES Large Krug's first clear experience reduction 50% ⇒ 30%
						
					
						Rift Scuttler
					Two Rift scuttlers spawn at the start of the game, but after both die, only one spawns at a time for the remainder of the game. That Rift Scuttler is tankier early and worth significantly more experience.
						
							Rift Scuttler isn’t the hotly contested objective we’d like it to be, so we’re looking to up the reward ya girl Scuttle gives to encourage more interaction between junglers—and teams—as the game progresses. Becoming the Scuttle slayer will now give junglers an experience edge over their opponents, not just a spot of vision.
						
						
							HEALTH 800-3920 (based on level) ⇒ 1200-2480 (based on level)
						
						
							EXPERIENCE GRANTED 10 ⇒ 115-230 (at levels 1-9)
						
						
							GOLD REWARD 70 ⇒ 70-140 (at levels 1-9)
						
						
							INITIAL SPAWN TIME 2:15 ⇒ 2:00
						
						
							newTWO CRAB ENTER At initial spawn, Scuttlers will spawn in the top and bottom river. Both must be killed before the respawn timer activates.
						
						
							THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE Once both initial Rift Scuttlers are killed, only one Rift Scuttler can be on the map at any given time for the rest of the game. Respawn locations are randomly determined, but signaled ahead of time with a respawn marker.
						
						
							RESPAWN TIME 180 seconds ⇒ 135 seconds
						
						
							newSHIELDS UP Scuttler's extra defenses now have a particle to indicate when she's protected and when the shield has been broken
						
						
							updatedMY CABBAGES Rift Scuttler's chance of trying to steal a honeyfruit is significantly decreased
						

							MANA REWARD ON DEATH 10-40 (based off missing mana percent) ⇒ 50-200 (based on missing mana percent)
						
					
						Items
					Starting jungle items have been updated. Just read the changelists.
						Hunter's Talisman
						
							Hunter’s Talisman has been relatively weak and we’re looking to buff it. These changes should also help expand the jungle roster to include champions that have mana problems in their first clear.
						
						
							KINDLE DAMAGE 45 damage over 5 seconds ⇒ 60 damage over 5 seconds
						
						
							KINDLE HEAL 25 health over 5 seconds ⇒ 30 health over 5 seconds
						
						
							updatedKINDLE Damage over 5 seconds is no longer amped to 75 if you have bonus health
						
						
							removedBASE MANA REGEN 150% while in the jungle
						
						
							newMAGIC OF THE JUNGLE Up to 40 mana per 5 seconds based on missing mana while in the jungle or river
						
						
							newLEVEL 2First Large Monster killed grants 120 bonus experience
						
						Hunter's Machete
						
							We’re removing the attack speed buff given by Hunter’s Machete and providing power elsewhere on the item. We initially gave it attack speed so junglers wouldn’t be forced into the Precision tree, but this has become less of a problem after the introduction of rune set bonus splitting. We'll be watching to see if any junglers are hit hard by these changes and try to compensate as necessary.
						
						
							DAMAGE ON-HIT VS MONSTERS 25 ⇒ 35
						
						
							removedCHOP CHOP Attacking jungle monsters no longer grants 15% bonus attack speed for 2 seconds
						
						
							newLEVEL 2First Large Monster killed grants 120 bonus experience

				Kill streak bounties are now granted only to the killer, not the team.
				
					Currently, the rewards a player gets for performing well are too split amongst the whole team, and we'll be looking to remedy that over time. We're starting this patch with Bounties, shifting the reward from a team one to a personal one, and we'll be investigating other team rewards going forward

  Greetings, Summoners,Welcome to patch 8.9. This patch, we're looking at mages, mana, and spellcasts. Over time, waveclear champions have slowly edged out all other champions in mid lane, to the detriment of overall playstyle diversity. Basically,
    it's become too easy to spam your spells on waves, and the items which give you the mana to do so are also just the best choices. We're updating the core mana items mages buy, the base mana/mana regen of mages, and more.On top of that,
    we're looking at game pacing over the next few patches. We want to make sure that there are fewer games that feel like they're lost but just won't end for awhile. The first step is looking at objectives. First, we're making Baron more accessible when
    you're ahead, but also more contestable in closer games. We're also upping the strength of Rift Herald when teams are able to safely shepherd it, but also increasing the ability of opposing teams to kill it when they see an opening.Finally,
    we're reworking Unsealed Spellbook. The old model mostly meant \"you get to flash more,\" and we're trying to create a keystone that really sells the fantasy of getting to play around with the whole spellbook, not just two summoner spells.So get out there and clear some waves (but not too many), bash Rift Herald into some towers, and swap some summoner spells! GLHF,

  Mages Changes
    
      
        Mages pretty much have two mana states: pre-mana purchase and post-mana purchase. During their first trip to lane, mages have to be very careful about when they cast spells or they risk going oom and being stuck in lane for a while with little
          or no mana. Once they've backed and acquired their laning item, many mages feel like they can spam spells almost mindlessly—especially with blue buff.We're making a lot of changes to base mana, mana regeneration, and mana sustain
          mage items with the overall goal of letting mages be more spell happy at the start of the game, but more conscientious about when they use their spells in the early-mid game. With a bit more attention needing to be paid to mana, we're pumping
          a little more power (mostly ability power) into their core items so that when they do land a spell, it'll pack more punch. Let's dive into the item changes first!
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Doran's Ring
        No longer gives base mana regen or mana regen on minion kill. Now gives flat mana regen and bonus damage vs minions.
        We're pushing Doran's Ring away from \"csing gives you mana\". Basically, incentivizing \"use spells on waves because you'll get the mana back\" puts mages in a weird cycle where trading is generally a worse choice than simply waveclearing. The new
          Doran's Ring will help mages feel better about csing without using spells, allowing them more opportunities to trade directly with their laning opponents.

        removedBASE MANA REGEN
          No longer gives base mana regen
        
        removedMANPIRE No longer returns mana on minion kill
        
        newFLAT MANA REGEN
          Now gives 5 mana regen per 5 seconds
        
        newMANA PUNCH
          Now gives +5 on-hit damage vs minions
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Lost Chapter
        Cost and ability power increased.
        Pushing Lost Chapter somewhat later in the laning phase means that its users will get fewer procs of its level-up effect, decreasing overall access to mana.

        Tear of the Goddess
        Total cost increased. Mana refund decreased. Max mana increase now increases current mana by current percentage of mana.
        Tear of the Goddess too comprehensively solves mana problems for the champions who build it. It'll still be the late-scaling item that delivers mad ability power once you've stacked it and upgraded it to Archangel's Staff, but it won't replenish
          your mana quite as well.

        COST

          When you gain max mana from Tear of the Goddess's passive, it preserves your percent current mana, rather than granting you the full max mana increase as a current mana increase. This applies to Manamune and Archangel's Staff as well.
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Hextech GLP-800
        Combine cost decreased. Mana increased. Slow duration increased. Missile speed increased. Missile spread time decreased.
        The old GLP-800 is still a bit on the weak side, and also feels less responsive than we'd like. Some feel-good buffs—as well as a bit more gold efficiency—should be just what the doctor ordered.

        Twin Shadows
        Ability power increased.
        We're always a little bit concerned about combat items which give slows. If an item lets you start a fight, it's a bit concerning when they can also make sure you win that fight. That being said, it looks like we released Twin Shadows
          weak even by that standard, so we're giving it a bit more ability power.

        Seeker's Armguard is a reactive purchase for mages who need extra armor in rough matchups. With the cost of Lost Chapter going up, we don't want Seeker's Armguard to take that much longer to purchase in those rough matchups.

        Spellbinder
        Base ability power increased. Ability power from activation decreased. Combine cost and total cost increased.
        This item is doing alright on champions who can spam spells and get its active charged, but that number of champions is pretty small. Shifting some of its active's ability power into its base statline should make the item slightly more accessible.

        Mejai's Soulstealer
        Glory stacks required for bonus movement speed decreased.
        Upgrading Dark Seal to Mejai's Soulstealer feels pretty awkward. First, you have to invest gold, but then, even if you're already at 10 stacks, you have to get a few more to get the bonus effect. This feels even worse when you would have had more
          than 10 stacks, but had been capped by Dark Seal.

        Luden's was already on the weak side, and with a number of ability power items getting buffs this patch, it would no longer have been cost-competitive.

        Turrets
        Damage to turrets on basic attacks from ability power increased and converted to magic damage.
        Taking turrets is an important mechanic in the game, and mages often get left out of that game. Currently, champions who build more ability power than attack damage get some percentage of their ability power as additional magic damage whenever
          they attack a tower. We're upping that ratio, and also converting their whole attack to magic damage, not just the bonus damage.

          50%
          ⇒
          60%
        
        newTHE WHOLE THING
          If a basic attack uses ability power bonus to turrets, the whole attack will convert to magic damage, rather than only the ability power scaling portion.
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        Champions
        25 mages have more mana regen and base mana, but less mana growth. 5 other mages have more mana regen.
        We’re increasing mana regen on the champions most affected by the changes to Doran's Ring and Last Chapter. Mages are also getting some changes to their mana pools and their mana growth. Overall, they’ll be up a bit of starting mana and mana regen,
          but be substantially down on mana per level.

        These champions, while also affected by the Doran's Ring, don't tend to build any of the mana items we're touching this patch. So, we're only adjusting their mana regen, but leaving their base mana and mana growth untouched.

        Amumu
        Q mana cost decreased.
        Amumu already has a pretty weak early game, but he's extra-penalized for failed ganks because they leave his mana pool too low to effectively return to clearing. This is especially bad for Amumu players who max Q, and prevents Amumu players from
          feeling comfortable opting into a utility-based build.

        Caitlyn
        Passive can no longer crit and now simply has a percentage increase over damage dealt to champions.
        Caitlyn's headshot against non-champions is a bit much, giving her neutral monster damage (and sustain from lifesteal) that is well above what feels appropriate. We're aligning the formula closer to Headshot's damage to champions to decrease her
          ability to quickly heal up off of monsters and minions.

        Irelia
        Passive now refreshes its duration when attacking large monsters.
        Now that Irelia is no longer a new—and thus potentially volatile—champion, we feel comfortable taking risks we didn't on her release. One of those risks was her potential to end up a stronger jungler than toplaner, and so we'd put an intentional
          limit on her clear speed. Now that she's in a more stable spot, we feel comfortable turning the parking brake off and letting her push down on that gas pedal.

        Passive - Ionian Fervor

        Ivern
        Passive health cost decreased. Passive maturation time decreased at later ranks. Q missile width increased.
        Ivern's passive makes him a unique jungler, and we're looking to keep that. However, his early game is a bit too punishing. We're also making his mid-game farming less costly and his Q a bit easier to land to smooth out the learning curve just
          a bit.

        Dialing back Kai'Sa's late game scaling a bit so she doesn't carry quite so hard. Specifically, the interaction of her abilities with certain items—primarily healing from spell damage—ramps her into territory which can get excessive.

          form.
        
        Kennen is one of those champions who has seen success with both attack damage and ability power builds. At the moment, both of them are struggling. We're looking to add strength to both playstyles, and also move some of Kennen's power around to
          ensure that those two playstyles are somewhat different from one another.

        Lux's high ranged poke—thanks to Lucent Singularity's consistency—limits how much power she can have elsewhere. By making E harder to land, we can put more power into her abilities and let her cast them more often, whether it's to waveclear, initiate
          trades, or go for picks.

        Poppy
        Base movement speed decreased. W movement speed and resistances decreased. Passive and E range increased. Snapcast R now knocks up for a lower duration and no longer makes enemies untargetable. Charged R missile speed increased.
        Steadfast Presence's passive gives Poppy a ton of resistances and its active gives her a ton of movement speed, and she relies on those to get in—and stay alive in—a teamfight. We're dialing back on some of those stats to make Poppy less overall
          consistent at closing the gap and staying alive, and in return strengthening the things she gets to do once while in the thick of things.

        A relatively unexplored part of Shyvana's fantasy is the whole flying-around-breathing-fire thing. We're moving around some of her ability power ratios to enable more people to try out this play pattern. That way, when players opt into that playstyle,
          she feels like a different dragon entirely: bombarding enemies with fireballs before descending on the enemy team, not just the same old dragon wearing a magical hat.

        Q's Transcendent bonus is now bonus damage to champions, not longer Sphere duration.
        Getting a maximum sphere ultimate off on should feel like the Syndra player has managed her Spheres well and was rewarded with a big play. Her passive's current Dark Sphere upgrade makes getting those big ultimates far too easy to pull off. We're
          shifting that bonus to increase the value of landing those Dark Spheres instead, so that Syndra players will feel more rewarded by landing a few Spheres before they go for the kill.

        Base damage decreased. Base health increased. Corruption damage increased.
        Some team compositions—those without tanks—find Baron way too threatening. We're shifting Baron's damage to distribute more over the whole party (and not just one target). To make sure Baron is still contestable, we're upping its health, so it
          takes longer to bring down. With Baron requiring more time to kill and spreading its damage around the whole team, opposing teams should have more time to contest, and a bigger teamfight advantage if they do.

          at the wrong time will be more easily punished. For teams that are even, getting an eye proc should successfully shut her down, but without it, expect her to continue her rampage.

        updatedUnsealed Spellbook
        Unsealed Spellbook is now a completely different keystone.
        Unsealed Spellbook was intended to offer a keystone option for players who wanted to be able to reactively opt into a different summoner spell to match the current game state. Problem is, the old Unsealed Spellbook required far too much advance
          planning, and then locked the player into that choice for far too long. In reality, many players took Unsealed Spellbook just for a lower Flash cooldown, not caring a ton about the swapping gameplay except to get Teleport every once in awhile.The new Unsealed Spellbook can be swapped anywhere—as long as you're out of combat. Once you use the new summoner spell, it's back to your old one. This solves both of the previous problems: requiring too much preparation, and locking
          you in for too long.

        newTAKE THIS!
          Swap one of your equipped summoner spells to a new, single-use summoner spell. After using the single-use summoner spell, your original summoner spell will swap back in.

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 8.8! As we move towards the middle of the season, the next few months will be jam-packed with a bunch of events (MSI, the launch of Clash, and start of the summer split to name a few). This puts a lot of pressure on specific patches, so \"big patch, small patch\" is gonna look like \"medium patch, medium patch\" for a little while.
		That being said, there are some pretty big changes this patch! First, we're taking a look at a duo of champions who we've struggled to handle. As we tried to make LeBlanc and Ahri less frustrating to play against, we ended up shifting them too far away from being assassins; instead shaping them into mages that kite opponents with mobility and crowd control. This patch, we're trying to push them back into an assassin playstyle, while keeping some of the fairness gains of their prior updates. We'll have to keep an eye on them in the coming patches, but in general they should excel at bursting priority targets and snowballing that lead into a win.
		GLHF, and we'll see you on the Rift!

				LeBlanc
				Updated. Just read it!
				
					First things first, this is a partial revert of the changes we made to LeBlanc during the Assassin Update. At the time, we had two goals for the update. For assassins as a whole, we wanted to give champions more time to play against assassins. For LeBlanc specifically, we wanted to reinforce her identity as a combo-based assassin who cared about the order in which she cast her spells. In LeBlanc's case, we feel that we've missed the mark on those goals, and we're turning back the clock on some of her changes.
					Those two goals can most be exemplified by two abilities: Passive - Sigil of Malice, and R - Mimic. However, neither of these changes have quite hit the mark, so we'll be reverting them, and making some tweaks to the rest of her kit for balance purposes. More on the changes to each ability below.
				
				updatedPassive - Mirror Image
				
					At the moment, no matter how far ahead she is, LeBlanc needs to stick around for around 2 seconds to have a shot at killing a target. It feels pretty awkward having the right thing to do often be holding off on using your abilities (until your passive has cooked).
				
				
					WHAT IS OLD IS NEW AGAIN When LeBlanc drops below 40% health, she becomes invisible for 1 second and creates a Mirror Image that deals no damage and lasts for up to 8 seconds
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where an attack launched by the clone from Passive - Mirror Image could deal damage if the clone died before that basic attack landed. Funny story, we had this bugfix ready to go when we initially reworked LeBlanc, but there was no need to ship it because that ability no longer existed. So now we're finally shipping it!
				
				Q - Sigil of Malice
				
					NAME Shatter Orb ⇒ Sigil of Malice
				
				
					newSigil of Malice Applies a mark to the target. Damaging the marked target with an ability detonates the mark to deal additional damage.

					COST 40 mana ⇒ 70 mana
				
				
					TETHER RANGE 885 ⇒ 865
				
				updatedR - Mimic
				
					LeBlanc's reworked ult was supposed to give her more interesting combos by allowing her to choose which ability to duplicate. In practice, however, it allows her to go all in and still have Mimicked Distortion to get far, far away if mistakes were made.
				
				
					MIMIC Casts LeBlanc's most recently cast spell upon pressing R

				Ahri
				E now amplifies Ahri's subsequent ability damage on the target it strikes. R and E base damage decreased. R damage ratio increased. Q no longer grants movement speed. W prioritizes targets Ahri has recently charmed or basic attacked.
				
					A lot of players enjoy to play Ahri as an aggressive, snowballing assassin who specializes in isolating a target and eliminating them. With her reach and playmaking potential allowing her to surge into other lanes, she wants to rack up kills around the map and lead her team to victory. At the moment, Ahri getting ahead just isn't the terrifying prospect it should be. We're upping her ability to prioritize all of her damage onto one champion so she has a better chance of going from fed to victorious.
					In exchange, that's going to mean Ahri has to give up some safety. As it is, the bonus movement speed attached to her Q allows her to toss it out just to avoid ganks. Making that Movement speed buff harder to access—and changing up her sustain model—should make her easier to punish in lane.
				
				updatedPassive - Vastayan Grace
				
					VASTAYAN GRACE If Ahri earns 2 spell hits against an enemy champion within a 1.5 second period, she gains 20% movement speed for 3 seconds (9 second cooldown)
				
				Q - Orb of Deception
				
					removedNOT SO FAST No longer grants movement speed
				
				
	newTHREE THREE HIT COMBO If Ahri earns 9 spell hits (max 3 per cast), she gains Essence Theft, causing her next Q cast that lands to restore 3/5/9/18 (at levels 1/6/11/16) (+9% ability power) health for each enemy hit.

				W - Fox-Fire
				
					COST 50 mana ⇒ 40 mana
				
				
					newFOX'S CUNNING Fox-Fire prioritizes any enemy champion affected by Charm's damage amp and the target Ahri most recently basic-attacked within the past 3 seconds
				
				
					RANGE VS PRIORITY TARGETS 725 (range vs non-priority targets unchanged at 700)
				
				
					DELAY FOR NON-PRIORITY TARGETING 0.25 seconds ⇒ 0.4 seconds (delay vs priority targets unchanged at 0.25 seconds)

				Irelia
				Base armor increased. Q damage to minions increased. R cooldown increased. R damage (missile and wall) decreased, especially at later ranks.
				
					Irelia's laning phase is pretty weak, but if she makes it to late game she's extremely strong. We're trimming her late-game power by decreasing her ult's base damage, and giving her more consistent lane strength in exchange .
				
				Base Stats
				
					BASE ARMOR 31 ⇒ 34
				
				Q - Bladesurge
				
					DAMAGE TO MINIONS 60% ⇒ 70%

				Azir
				Soldier damage to non-primary targets decreased at earlier levels.
				
					Azir's high waveclear in the early game gives him too much control over the tempo of a lane.
				
				W - Arise!
				
					DAMAGE TO NONPRIMARY TARGETS 40/70/100% (at levels 1/6/11) ⇒ 25/50/75/100% at (at levels 1/6/11/16)

					STAND AT ATTENTION Bonus resistances are now applied more responsively
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Galio
				R cooldown increased.
				
					As players have learned how to position themselves preemptively to use Galio's ultimate well, it's become pretty clear that it's available too often.
				
				R - Hero's Entrance
				
					COOLDOWN 180/150/120 seconds ⇒ 200/180/160 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Graves
				Health growth increased. R cooldown decreased.
				
					For a ranged champion, Graves has to get pretty up close and personal to contribute, and right now his baseline tankiness isn't enough to consistently sustain that.
				
				Base Stats
				
					HEALTH GROWTH 84 ⇒ 92
				
				R - Collateral Damage
				
					COOLDOWN 120/100/80 ⇒ 110/85/60
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Janna
				Movement speed decreased. W damage decreased.
				
					Janna's high speed allows her a bit too much control over trades, while the base strength of Zephyr means she's just winning those trades too often
				
				Base Stats
				
					MOVEMENT SPEED 320 ⇒ 315
				
				W - Zephyr
				
					BASE DAMAGE 60/105/150/195/240 ⇒ 55/100/145/190/235
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kai'sa
				Health regen and health regen growth decreased. Q damage ratio decreased.
				
					In her early patches, Kai'Sa was struggling to get through the laning phase, so we boosted her laning phase with some buffs. As players continue to learn how to play her, we're stripping that strength away.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE HEALTH REGEN 6.2 ⇒ 5.5
				
				
					HEALTH REGEN GROWTH 0.75 ⇒ 0.55

				Lissandra
				Q mana cost decreased. R cooldown decreased at earlier ranks.
				
					Lissandra has very sharp strengths as an initiator and mid-range damage dealer, and has historically need to be gated by mana and cooldowns to keep her in line. Right now she's struggling, so we're giving her more opportunities to do those things.
				
				Q - Ice Shard
				
					COST 85 mana ⇒ 75 mana
				
				R - Frozen Tomb
				
					COOLDOWN 130/105/80 seconds ⇒ 120/100/80 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Nautilus
				Mana increased. Attack damage increased. Q cooldown decreased at earlier ranks.
				
					Nautilus is struggling a bit, and we want to try to give him strength that will help him find success in all of his historical roles (top, jungle, and support). His identity as a giant anchor-thrower should be pretty relevant in each of those lanes, so that's a good place to start.
				
				Base Stats
				
					BASE MANA 334 ⇒ 400
				
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 57.54 ⇒ 61
				
				Q - Dredge Line

				Ryze
				E mana cost increased at early ranks.
				
					Ryze's high waveclear in the early game gives him too much control over the tempo of a lane.
				
				E - Spell Flux
				
					COST 40/55/70/85/100 mana ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100 mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Sion
				Q damage ratio decreased at earlier ranks. Q base damage increased at early ranks
				
					Sion doesn't currently sacrifice much damage in order to max E - Roar of the Slayer instead of Q - Decimating Smash. In return he gains strong ranged poke, which is making him a dominant pick not only in top lane, but also mid in some matchups. There are times when it should make sense to max E first (ranged harass, using the slow to make Q easier to hit), but we want to make this less of a clear-cut choice.
				
				Q - Decimating Smash
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.65 total attack damage ⇒ 0.45/0.5/0.55/0.6/0.65 total attack damage

				Tahm Kench
				E health restore decreased. W no longer grants Tahm Kench movement speed while moving towards enemy champions with a friend in his belly.
				
					Tahm Kench is good at protecting allies by hiding them in his belly, but the high durability his E grants him means opponents don't feel great about the damage they land on him instead of his allies. Dialing that back should help him feel more fair to play against.
					There's also something a bit more complicated here, and that's the bonus movement speed Devour gives Tahm Kench when running towards enemy champions. Because \"towards\" has a lot of leeway, in scattered teamfights \"away from the person who is killing me\" often means \"towards some other opponent\", which is allowing Tahm Kench too much escapability for both him and an ally.

				Taliyah
				Base health decreased. Q Cooldown increased at earlier ranks.
				
					Taliyah has become a prized pick, thanks to her ability to shove and roam. We're pulling back some of her waveclear, but also decreasing her tankiness so that assassins can be a more consistent counterpick against her.
				
				Base Stats
				
					HEALTH 532 ⇒ 502
				
				Q - Threaded Volley
				
					COOLDOWN 9/7.5/6/5.5/3 seconds ⇒ 11/9/7/5/3 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Varus
				W on-hit damage decreased. W now has an active which empowers Varus' next Q to deal bonus damage.
				
					Piercing Arrow is Varus' most iconic spell, but it's pretty underwhelming in many of his current builds. We're not looking to change the way he builds, but we do want to create more incentives for him to care about charging his Q, even when he's building on-hit. Given that he was pretty balanced before, adding a whole new active requires us to trim some power elsewhere.
				
				Passive - Living Vengeance
				
					BONUS ATTACK SPEED ON CHAMPION KILL 50% ⇒ 30%

					newACTIVE Varus' next Q - Piercing Arrow deals additional damage equal to 6/7/8/9/10% of the target's missing HP. Damage is increased by up to 50% (to 9/10.5/12/13.5/15%) based on charge time.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Vi
				Base armor decreased. Armor growth increased. Health regen and health regen growth increased. Passive and Q cooldowns decreased at early levels. E mana cost decreased.
				
					We're looking to buff Vi, but also think it would be cool if she could sneak back into top lane (fun fact, Vi was designed as a top laner before becoming a jungler). By bringing some of her cooldowns and costs down and upping her health regen, we're aiming to give her more strength in solo lanes as well as in the jungle.

				Xayah
				Base health regen decreased. Passive pass through damage decreased at early levels.
				
					Xayah is currently able to coast through hard matchups and get to her strong mid and late game too easily.

				Archangel's Staff
				Mana-to-ability-power conversion decreased.
				
					Archangel's Staff is spiking too early, so we're decreasing some of its ability scaling before it upgrades to Seraph's Embrace.

	Trinkets
	
		
			
				Sweeping Lens removed. Oracle Alteration now available at level 1. Swapping trinkets now retains the same percentage cooldown as the previous one.
				
					The decision-making surrounding trinket swaps is currently a bit more complicated than it needs to be. By making swaps more consistent and decreasing the number of potential swaps, we're hoping to make the gains from those swaps more clear.

	Back to top
	Homestart
	
		
			
				Homestart buff is granted by fountain until slightly later in the game. Homestart now begins to fall off at outer turrets, not the river.
				
					Homestart gives too significant of a defender's advantage to champions who never cross into the river. Defensively, champions can run out to the brush near the river, retain the movement speed buff, and easily run away from any invaders - who lost their movement speed bonus once they set foot in the river. We're changing the movement speed buff to fall off a bit closer to your side of the map to make early aggression slightly more likely to succeed.
				
				
					FOUNTAIN GRANTS HOMESTART BUFF UNTIL 35 seconds into the game ⇒ 55 seconds into the game
				
				
					removedCOLD FEET Homestart buff no longer falls off instantly after crossing the river line
				
				
					NO PLACE LIKE HOME : Homestart buff rapidly decays over 0.75 seconds after crossing the outer turret line

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 8.7, the one where we nerf Irelia. Sorry, I'm being told that's update Irelia. Everyone's favorite Blade Dancer is hitting the Rift with a new model and kit.
		We're also following up on the Duskblade changes from last patch, visiting the assassins who were affected more—or less—than we'd expected.
		Finally, we're hitting Ninja Tabi. Those boots had taken over as the dominant choice, and while that makes sense on tanks, it's a bit concerning when they're such a compelling purchase for marksmen as well.
		So hop out on the Rift, and remember, GLHF,

	Mid-Patch Updates
    
        
        
                Irelia 4/4 Balance Update
       Q damage ratio decreased. Base attack damage decreased. Base armor decreased.
            
                 There's honestly not much to say here. We always expect there to be a learning curve on new or reworked champions, and we try to make sure they release at a playable state of balance. In this case, we overshot pretty hard, and Irelia's just far too strong.
                 
                 You know what they say, better nerf Irelia

				Gragas
				Q ability power ratio increased. W ability power ratio increased. W damage reduction scales with ability power. W damage reduction duration decreased.
				
					Like with Galio, we think it's cool when Gragas is able to feel good about building ability power when he gets ahead. He could use some more strength anyway right now, so we're giving him a bit more room to build aggressively.
				
				Q - Barrel Roll
				
					DAMAGE RATIO 0.6 ability power ⇒ 0.7 ability power
				
				W - Drunken Rage
				
					RATIO 0.3 ability power ⇒ 0.5 ability power

				Elise
				Spider Q base damage increased. Human E cooldown decreased at early ranks.
				
					Elise is a historic jungle staple, but we haven't spied her on the Rift in a while. Some more venom in her bite and a few more cocoons—her bread and butter abilities—should get her back on two feet again. Or eight.
				
				Q - Venomous Bite
				
					BASE DAMAGE 60/100/140/180/220 ⇒ 70/110/150/190/230
				
				E - Cocoon
				
					COOLDOWN 14/13/12/11/10 seconds ⇒ 12/11.5/11/10.5/10 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Hecarim
				W healing increased.
				
					A melee champion who likes to build semi-squishy needs more durability in his kit if he's going to cut it in a sustained teamfight. More healing from W should help Hecarim turn his trot into a gallop some games.
				
				W - Spirit of Dread
				
					HEAL 20% of damage taken by enemies ⇒ 30% of damage taken by enemies
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ivern
				W cast range increased. Daisy acquires targets more aggressively. Daisy's area of effect damage reduction now also applies to damage from epic monsters.
				
					The preseason changes overall made clearing jungle camps easier. With how much strength Ivern has tied up in his unique clear mechanic, this has left him feeling a bit underwhelming. We're always concerned with where we put power on Ivern's kit, so we're starting with some feel-good changes, and we'll follow up with more in future patches if need be.
				
				Q - Rootcaller
				
					BUGFIX Dashing over walls to jungle monsters now works more consistently
				
				W - Brushmaker
				
					CAST RANGE 800 ⇒ 1000
				
				R - Daisy!
				
					DAISY! NOT DAISY Daisy more aggressively acquires enemies to attack
				
				
					FLOWER POWER Daisy's AoE damage reduction now also protects her from epic monsters
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Karthus
				Q base damage increased.
				
					This is a pretty significant power increase for Karthus, but he could use it. He currently gets pushed around in lane, so we're looking to put some strength into his trading.
				
				Q - Lay Waste
				
					BASE DAMAGE 40/60/80/100/120 ⇒ 50/70/90/110/130
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kayn
				Passive gains more points early, fewer points later.
				
					Kayn's passive—specifically the way it ramps up over time—means that a lot of Kayn's early actions feel less impactful than they should. First, the low number of points he gets early on makes early ganking and fighting a lot less worthwhile than it should be. Second, the high number of points he gets later on means that his later fights matter so much that they too easily outweigh the earlier ones. We're moving around some of that point accrual so that his actions in the early game matter more.
				
				Passive - The Darkin Scythe
				
					HEAD START Increased the amount of points gained from interacting with enemy champions pre-10 minutes
				
				
					IN THE PAST NOW Decreased the amount of points gained from interacting with enemy champions post-15 minutes
				
				Q - Reaping Slash
				
					ONE TWO SLASH Other abilities can now be queued up while casting Q
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Leona
				
					Leona's attack reset makes attack damage pretty valuable for her, so we're shifting that to being her default adaptive stat.
				
				
					ONE SUN TWO STUN Leona defaults to attack damage as her default adaptive stat
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Lux
				R cooldown refund on kill increased at early ranks; also triggers on enemy champions who die shortly after being hit by Final Spark.
				
					When we added the cooldown refund on Lux's ultimate, we wanted to give her a more streamlined path to snowball a lead into a win. At the moment, that takes too long to kick in.
				
				R - Final Spark
				
					COOLDOWN REFUND ON KILL 10/30/50% ⇒ 30/40/50%
				
				
					THE SPARK THAT LIGHTS THE FIRE Cooldown refund is granted if one or more enemy champions die to Final Spark ⇒ die within 1.75 seconds of being hit by Final Spark
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Malphite
				Attack damage growth increased. E ratio increased. R cooldown decreased.
				
					Malphite is definitely a sedimentary rock champion: He has layers. Some players build him tanky, others build ability power, and some even build Trinity Force. At the moment he's underperforming, and we're looking to give him power that suits all of his builds.
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH 3.375 ⇒ 4
				
				E - Ground Slam
				
					RATIO 0.20 ability power ⇒ 0.60 ability power
				
				R - Unstoppable Force
				
					COOLDOWN 130/115/100 ⇒ 130/105/80
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Nocturne
				Bonus attack damage while on Q trail increased.
				
					The Duskblade changes hit Nocturne harder than we expected, so we're giving him some more damage.
				
				Q - Duskbringer
				
					BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE ON TRAIL 15/25/35/45/55 ⇒ 20/30/40/50/60
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Olaf
				R initial movement speed buff decreased.
				
					As players have started to pick up Predator it's become clear that, in tandem with its active, his R is too consistent an engagement tool.
				
				R - Ragnarok
				
					HASTE TOWARDS ENEMY CHAMPIONS 50/60/70% ⇒ 20/45/70%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Quinn
				Fixed several bugs related to R.
				R - Behind Enemy Lines/Skystrike
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Quinn's R - Skystrike would fail to activate when cast after respawning
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Quinn's R - Behind Enemy Lines could not be cast until she respawned or returned to the summoning platform if she got interrupted during her E - Vault dash
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Quinn's Q - Blinding Assault would visually pass through targets if cast during R - Behind Enemy Lines
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rengar
				Base attack damage increased. Rengar's Q no longer causes him to sometimes cancel his actions.
				
					We've been tweaking Rengar since the revert of his Q (and the changes to Duskblade). He's almost there, but he still needs a bit more power in his early game.
				
				Base Stats
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 65 ⇒ 68
				
				
					DISTRACTED CAT Fixed a number of cases where Rengar would stop attacking and stand still after using Q on an enemy champion
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Rumble
				Q damage increased at early ranks; damage to minions adjusted to be roughly unchanged.
				
					Rumble could use more trading strength, but we don't want to give him too much waveclear in return.
				
				Q - Flamespitter
				
					BASE DAMAGE 135/180/225/270/315 ⇒ 175/210/245/280/315
				
				
					DAMAGE TO MINIONS 75% ⇒ 60/65/70/75/80%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Sejuani
				Health growth decreased. E stun duration decreased at later ranks.
				
					Sejuani is supposed to be the tank who excels in skirmishes and is slightly less strong in longer teamfights, but her high crowd control and durability makes her pretty solid at the latter as well.
				
				Base stats
				
					HEALTH GROWTH 95 ⇒ 88
				
				E - Permafrost
				
					STUN DURATION 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds ⇒ 1/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Shaco
				Q bonus damage ratio reduced; window to proc bonus damage and cooldown reduction effect reduced.
				
					Last patch gave Deceive a lot more power to compensate for the Duskblade changes. It was a bit much, so this patch we're tightening up the window in which he can use that power.
				
				Q - Deceive
				
					BE SNEAKIER Shaco's next basic attack within 2.5 seconds ⇒ 0.25 seconds of exiting invisibility deals bonus damage and reduces Deceive's cooldown (cooldown reduction on proc still 2.5 seconds)
				
				
					EMPOWERED ATTACK RATIO 0.7 bonus attack damage ⇒ 0.4 bonus attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Swain
				Q cooldown increased at early ranks. Q base damage decreased.
				
					Oops. Swain has finally hit the \"too strong\" point, so it's time to reduce some of his baseline power.
				
				Passive - Ravenous Flock
				
					THE FLOCK GATHERS Ravenous Flock's icon can now be pinged to show allies the remaining cooldown on the pull
				
				Q - Death's Hand
				
					COOLDOWN 5.5/4.75/4/3.25/2.5 seconds ⇒ 7.5/6.25/5/3.75/2.5 seconds
				
				
					BASE DAMAGE 65/85/105/125/145 ⇒ 55/75/95/115/135
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Warwick
				Warwick's Q no longer sometimes deals damage twice.
				Q - Jaws of the Beast
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where sometimes Warwick's Q would deal damage twice
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zed
				Q damage falloff to units beyond first decreased.
				
					The Duskblade update hit Zed harder than expected, so we're giving back some of the strength we took away last patch.
				
				Q - Razor Shuriken
				
					DAMAGE TO UNITS BEYOND FIRST 50% ⇒ 60%

	Items
	
		
			
				
				Guinsoo's Rageblade
				Costs more.
				
					Guinsoo's Rageblade is pretty overtuned for its price after the update, so we're re-upping the gold cost to make sure it hits the game at a more appropriate time.
				
				
					COST 3000 gold ⇒ 3300 gold
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Locket of the Iron Solari
				Shield base and per-level scaling decreased; bonus health ratio increased early, decreased late. Shield cooldown increased; shield stacking penalties are harsher.
				
					Locket is really strong right now, crowding out other options for support or jungle tanks, so we're toning down the strength of the shield significantly.
				
				
					BASE SHIELD 38 ⇒ 30
				
				
					SHIELD PER TARGET'S LEVEL 22 ⇒ 15
				
				
					BONUS HEALTH RATIO 2-36% (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 20%
				
				
					COOLDOWN 90 seconds ⇒ 120 seconds
				
				
					MULTIPLE SHIELD REDUCTION AMOUNT 50% ⇒ 75%
				
				
					MULTIPLE SHIELD REDUCTION DURATION 8 seconds ⇒ 20 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ninja Tabi
				Armor decreased. Basic attack damage reduction increased.
				
					Ninja Tabi have become a ubiquitous purchase recently. It's fine when tanks pick up Ninja Tabi—after all, their core job is to tank damage—but when marksmen are buying them, it's probably a bit much. We want Ninja Tabi to remain a core purchase for tanks who need to be able to take punishment from marksmen and other basic-attackers, but less for marksmen who just want some armor to survive against assassins.
				
				
					ARMOR 30 ⇒ 20
				
				
					BASIC ATTACK DAMAGE REDUCTION 10% ⇒ 12%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Aura Items
				Large champions no longer become bigger than their item auras.
				
					Some champions got so big that they covered the whole space of their auras, rendering them pretty pointless to purchase. For those champions, the auras now increase in size alongside the champions. You'll notice that Frozen Heart isn't in here; no champion ever got big enough to invalidate that aura.
				
				
					SORRY, CHO The following item auras now increase in size if their users increase in size:
				
				Bami's Cinder, Sunfire Cape, Forgefire Cape, and Enchantment: Cinderhulk
					Abyssal Mask and Infernal Mask
					Righteous Glory's proximity check
				
		
	
	
		
			
				Relic Shield Line
				Passive gold generation down.
				
					Relic Shield is still slightly overperforming compared to the other support items.
				
				Relic Shield
				
					GOLD PER 10 2 ⇒ 1
				
				Targon's Brace
				
					GOLD PER 10 4 ⇒ 1
				
				Remnant of the Aspect
				
					GOLD PER 10 4 ⇒ 1

	Runes
	
		
			
				Resolve Tree
				Path bonus grants lower health early; more late.
				
					The early burst of tankiness Resolve gives is a bit much early durability. We're taking some of its early game power out and shifting it to late game.
				
				
					RESOLVE PRIMARY 65 health ⇒ 15-135 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					RESOLVE + INSPIRATION 130 health ⇒ 30-270 health (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					INSPIRATION + RESOLVE 140 health ⇒ 35-300 health (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				updated
				Manaflow Band
				Hitting enemy champions with spells grants maximum mana, up to 10 times. Once max stacks have been reached, Manaflow Band restores missing mana every 5 seconds.
				
					Manaflow Band has quietly been one of the strongest runes—on the champions who use it best. To make it more accessible, we're tying its variance to game skill and landing spells, not the cost of those spells.
				
				
					PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Hitting enemy champions with a spell grants 25 maximum mana, up to 250 mana
				
				
					COOLDOWN 15 seconds
				
				
					MASTER Upon earning 250 mana, Manaflow Band restores 1% of your missing mana every 5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				updated
				Presence of Mind
				Enemy takedowns restore 20% of your maximum mana and refund 10% of your ultimate's cooldown.
				
					Presence of Mind is extremely valuable on some champions and barely noticeable on others. Specifically, champions with long cooldowns can't benefit from its current effect, so we're moving it back to a more generic power that is consistent across all champions.
				
				
					THE ULTIMATE MANA REFUND Enemy champion takedowns restore 20% of your maximum mana and refund 10% of your ultimate's cooldown
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Legend: Tenacity
					
						Underpicked and underperforming.
					
				
					TENACITY 5% + 1.5% per stack ⇒ 5% + 2.5% per stack
				
				
					MAX TENACITY 20% at 10 stacks ⇒ 30% at 10 stacks

						We're looking to up the damage this brings against full-durability champions.
					
				
					DAMAGE MULTIPLIER 4-10% (at 150-2000 max health difference) ⇒ 4-12% (at 150-2000 max health difference)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Zombie Ward
					
						Zombie Ward's double vision whammy, providing vision when you've just taken it away, is too good when its users get ahead.
					
				
					ZOMBIE WARD DURATION 60-180 seconds (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 30 seconds at levels 1-4; 36-120 seconds at levels 5-18

						Currently being outperformed by other competing runes.

	Minions
	
		
			
				Melee minions and cannons worth more gold. Caster minions worth less gold.
				
					Cannons are natural focal points for the game: little mini-objectives to fight over. We're making them worth a bit more gold—and a bit harder to kill—to up the ante.
				
				Melee Minions
				
					BASE GOLD 20 ⇒ 21
				
				
					GOLD GROWTH EVERY 3 WAVES 0.125 ⇒ 0
				
				Caster Minions

	Crest of Cinders
	
		
			
				
					The amount of damage red buff adds to a jungler's ability to push a tower after a successful gank is pretty high, and that can make the difference between a tower killed and a tower at half health. There's not much gameplay around this distinction; it was just sometimes escalating how quickly towers fell, so we're removing it.
				
				
					STONE CAN'T BURN Crest of Cinders' burn effect no longer damages turrets

		Attack Move on Cursor
	
		
			
				
					CLOSE ENOUGH The \"Attack Move on Cursor\" setting now checks a larger area for a valid target before defaulting to attacking the closest unit to your champion

	Voice Chat
	
		
			
				With voice chat out in the wild, we’re doing some quality of life buffs based on your feedback. And no, not your mic feedback.
				
					The fixes are: Better audio notifications when players join your party or unmute themselves, decoupled voice controls from the scoreboard, and an auto-mute when you are afk.
				
				
					Beep boop Audio notifications for when a player joins your party and voice chat now work more consistently across the client
				
				
					Boop beep Audio notifications now play when a party member reconnects to voice
				
				
					Conscious uncoupling In settings, you can now separate the in-game voice control panel from the scoreboard
				
				
					Mute after 10 If you’re away from the client, (that’s 10 minutes without touching anything), your mic will auto-mute. Your mic sparks back up once you’re back.

				Fixed a bug where Circlet of the Iron Solari (Ornn's Locket of the Iron Solari upgrade) would not grant shields to units affected by a recent cast of Locket or Circlet of the Iron Solari

  Greetings, Summoners,Welcome to patch 8.6, the next big patch in our little patch, big patch cycle. This time around, we're taking a look at Duskblade and how it affects its core users. We think it brings too much power, but we wanted to
    make sure we gave those champions additional power if we're stripping some from Duskblade.Then, we're introducing two new runes: one for champions who want to stay in fights for extended durations, and another for squishy champions who
    want a burst of early durability.Finally, while we're mostly happy with where they've ended up since the update, we're still tweaking some of the mage items.GLHF,

  Mid-Patch Updates

    
        
            3/21 Kai'Sa Balance Update
            Base attack damage decreased. Q mana cost increased.
            
                 Last patch, we gave Kai'Sa some reactive buffs to give players more room to learn her kit. Now that players have had time to understand her strengths and weaknesses - and how to play around them - we're pulling some of those props back out. There are other buffs shipping for Kai'Sa this patch, and we think those changes are a better direction overall for her strength profile.
            
            Kai'Sa
            
                BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 65 ⇒ 63
            
            Q - Icathian Rain

            
                COST 45 mana ⇒ 55 mana
            
        
    


  Duskblade Champions
    
      
        
        Duskblade of Draktharr
        Nightstalker damage decreased and equalized between ranged and melee champions. Melee basic attacks instantly kill wards disabled by Duskblade. Blackout won't trigger during Red Sweeper.
        Nightstalker is responsible for too much of the damage of its core users, making them overbearing when they can purchase it early, and underwhelming if they delay or don't purchase the item. We're pulling some of the strict nuking power out of
          the item and putting some of that strength into the item's vision control. Some of the lost damage will also be compensated directly into the kits of its core users.

        NIGHTSTALKER DAMAGE (MELEE)
          65-320 (at levels 1-18)
          ⇒

        W - Void Spike
        At the moment, the monster damage in W ties Kha'Zix to the jungle. We'd like to give him a chance to spread his wings elsewhere, so we're swapping that power for a bigger Q buff than the Duskblade changes warrant alone.

        Kai'sa
        Attack range increased. Passive and Q ability power ratios increased. Q range increased. W ability power ratio decreased. E cast time decreased. E movement speed increased. R radius increased.
        Kai'Sa's a new champion, and that means that players are still learning how she works—and in a lot of ways, so are we. One thing that really stands out is that? she does pretty well in the games where she gets ahead, but currently she's
          struggling pretty hard to ever get leads in the first place.The main culprit is her laning phase, where her low range makes it hard for her to get the good trades she needs, so we're starting by minorly buffing her range. We're also
          buffing the mobility her E gives, both by increasing the movement speed and decreasing the cast time, which should allow her a bit more positional freedom to choose when and where she fights.Her ability power ratios are also way
          too low to fulfill her flexible itemization fantasy, and with the Guinsoo's Rageblade changes below, we have some room to make those ratios a lot stronger.

        Shurelya's Reverie
        When you a support but you and your squad wanna go in.
        With the removal of Talisman of Ascension, the support item landscape was missing the \"everybody in\" item. Since we were remaking it anyway, we took a look at who we wanted picking up this item. Ultimately, we wanted to make sure that it wasn't
          super attractive to tanks (they already have Righteous Glory), but felt good on most other supports.

        When we moved ability power off of Abyssal Mask and onto Banshee's Veil, we hoped to cement Abyssal as less of a core mage item and more of a tank pickup to boost allied mages. However, the high range on its aura has made it a compelling damage
          option on mages that also provides defensive value intended for tanks. As a result, we're seeing a lot of mages pick it up as a \"get me through mid lane with no interaction possible\" item, without paying much of a hit to their late game damage.
          Shrinking the aura will sharpen the intended user base to champions who want to get up close and personal.

        Dead Man's Plate
        Slow is now magic damage instead of physical. Momentum generation tweaked.
        Dead Man's Plate is underperforming at the moment, and we're taking a pass at giving it some love. While we do so, we'd like to sharpen its identity as the item for fighters, who really shine when they get the opportunity to maneuver around a
          fight laying down damage.As such, we're going under the hood and tweaking the way DMP generates Momentum. If you're able to lock a target in place (hello Maokai/Nautilus) and prevent them from kiting you that much, you won't get
          as much damage and you're unlikely to get a lot of slows. On the other hand, if you're darting around a fight (Irelia, Renekton) you'll feel the full impact of the passive.Hopefully, when fighters see this item, they'll think to
          themselves \"yes.\". When tanks see this item, they'll think to themselves \"no.\"

        Guinsoo's Rageblade currently has two problems: It's only good on a select few champions, and on those champions it serves as an insane first item spike. We're hitting both problems by changing its statline and on-hits to scale directly with other
          stats. TL;DR, Guinsoo's shouldn't be as immediately powerful of a rush item, but it fits into a few more types of builds.

        Statikk Shiv
        Energized proc damage decreased at higher levels. Lightning no longer deals bonus damage to minions.
        The combination of proc damage and wave clear is allowing any marksman to be their team's wave clear all on their own, making Statikk Shiv too dominant a pick over the other zeal items.

        We're taking this opportunity to match the damage of Rapid Firecannon to that of Statikk Shiv, to make it a more clear choice between extra range and extra wave clear.

  Summoner Spells
    
      
        
        Ignite
        Damage increased.
        For a while now, Heal and Teleport have been outclassing Ignite mid lane, especially in pro play. To increase diversity in Summoner spells, we're pushing a bit more power into Ignite.

        DAMAGE
          70-410 (at levels 1-18)

        Heal
        Cooldown increased.
        In general, defensive spells should have higher cooldowns than offensive spells. That is, if two opposing player uses Heal and Ignite in the same fight, there should be a window where the Ignite player has a summoner spell edge and can try and
          make another play. Currently, Heal's cooldown is probably a bit too low for players to take advantage of that disparity, so we're upping it.

        Conqueror
        New Precision keystone.
        We wanted to introduce a keystone for champions who excel in long, drawn-out fights—especially melee champions.

        CONQUERER
          After 4 seconds in combat, your first attack against an enemy champion grants you 10-35 attack damage, based on level, for 3 seconds, and converts 20% of your damage to champions to true damage
        
        MELEE ONLY
          Damaging enemy champions refreshes this buff
        

      
    
  

  
    
      
        Bone Plating
        Bone Plating duration decreased.
        Bone Plating was intended as an anti-burst rune, but thanks to its long duration it's being used as a generic anti-damage rune. Shortening the duration should make it less generically good while preserving its anti-burst power.

        Chrysalis
        New Resolve rune in the Resistance row.
        Many champions—especially carry-style champions—might want defensive stats to get through the laning phase, but ultimately want carry stats for the late game. This is the rune for them.

        CHRYSALIS
          Start the game with an additional 60 health. When you get 4 takedowns, consume that health to gain an adaptive bonus of 9 attack damage or 15 ability power.
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        Removed Runes
        Iron Skin and Mirror Shell in the Resistance row of the Resolve tree have been removed.
        Iron Skin and Mirror Shell weren't adding much to the runes landscape; they were largely just flat stats that didn't feel compelling to a lot of characters. Now that we've added Chrysalis (and Bone Plating two patches ago), we can remove Iron
          Skin/Mirror Shell.

        Rune Selection Upgrades
        HEY LISTEN
          New or reworked runes will now have an indicator and the drawer they're in will auto-pop open
        
        LOOK AT THIS STUFF
          Last patch we added a feature where we auto-swapped removed runes and put an indicator on the affected pages. This patch, we're adding an indicator to the specific rune so it's easier to see what has been auto-swapped.
        
        WHICH RUNE
          Fixed some buggy behavior in substyle selection (in particular, the ring which shows you which rune will be replaced was often wrong)

  One for All
    
      
        It's back!
        Get silly this season by playing the same champ as your teammates in this wacky and accelerated twist on Summoner's Rift. One For All springs back into action from 3/30/18 at 8:00 AM PT - 4/16/18 at 11:59 PM PT.

        TL;DR
        5v5 battle on Summoner's Rift
          You play the same champion as your teammates
          Everyone votes for their choice during champ select. Champions with at least four votes get locked in.
        Updates
        Each player can now ban a champion
          New or updated champs available since last run:
          Camille
            Rakan
            Xayah
            Kayn
            Ornn
            Zoe
            Kaisa
            Many reworked champions (Swain, Urgot, Galio, etc)
          Fast and Furious
        Start at level 3
          Experience and Gold gain sped up by 30%
          Dragon and Baron spawn sooner and more often
          Bonus out-of-combat move speed
        STACKS ON STACKS:
        Shields now stack!
          Most buffs and debuffs stack! Some examples...
          Oriannas can now have up to 4 of The Ball floating around her using E - Command: Protect
            Each Nunu in a game can give up to 120% bonus ability power to a single Nunu using W - Blood Boil, for a grand total of 600% potential bonus ability power
            Each Nami can buff an ally with E - Tidecaller's Blessing at the same time, resulting in three SUPER CHARGED Nami basic attacks!
            Sivir has claimed the title of The Fast, at a recorded top speed of ~2000 while all Sivirs are R - On the Hunt
          Slows don't stack! The slows will still be put on the target, but only the strongest slow applies.
        That's it! Go forth and slam your opponents with Leap of Faith x 5, or maybe a Penta Umbral Trespass.

    Honor
  
    
      
        After popping the hood on Honor, we're seeing that the path back from dishonor is a bit too harsh. So now it's less steep. There are no other changes to Honor.

        HONOR RECLIMBS
          The requirements to move up from Dishonorable to Honor level 2 have been lowered

  Parties Level Up
    
      
        Voice Chat
        Later this patch, your party won't ignore your cries for help because they'll hear you in voice chat. 
        Voice works for any party of two or more players. As soon as you join a friend's party you'll connect to voice chat automatically and remain connected for as many games as you play together.

        QUEUE TOGETHER SPEAK TOGETHER
          Voice chat only works for parties that queue together
        
        TALK ME THROUGH IT
          Your party connects to voice chat automatically right from the lobby. It's that easy.
        
        I CAN'T HEAR YOU
          Every player can adjust their team's volume in-game by clicking the mic icon at the bottom of their screen

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 8.5, the one that's the \"small patch\" to 8.4's \"big patch\". This patch is actually a large download, because we're updating some of our in-game assets. More on that here!
		But back to gameplay! This patch we're taking a look at professional outliers, some of whom have been problem children for awhile now (Azir, Galio, Ryze). We're also revisiting Zoe after heavy nerfs last patch, giving her power back in places we think should be healthier in the long run.
		Then, we've given a couple of juggernauts (Skarner/Volibear) more utility since preseason, but those changes have left them overly dominant. We're dialing back to a middle ground in between their old state and their current state.
		Finally, League of Legends newest marksman, Kai'Sa, is setting foot on the Rift. Bring an umbrella: the forecast calls for Icathian Rain.
		GHLF,

Mid-Patch Updates

	
		
			3/8 Support Item Update
			Bandit passive removed. Targon's passive gold increased. Frostfang's Tribute gold increased. Nomad's Medallion gold coin reward increased.
			
				We're still seeing non-supports use gold items to ramp up their gold generation, and the key culprit here is the Bandit passive. We're removing it and adding more gold into the existing sources within each item line.
				NOTE: we'd considered holding this change for 8.6, but data from the start of 8.5 shows that it's still quite necessary, so we're putting it in now.
			
			All Support Items

			Targon's Brace and Remnant of the Aspect
			
				PASSIVE GOLD GENERATION 2 gold per 10 seconds ⇒ 4 gold per 10 seconds

				FROSTFANG & EYE OF THE WATCHERS TRIBUTE GOLD 15 gold ⇒ 20 gold
			
			Nomad's Medallion and Remnant of the Ascended
			
				GOLD COIN REWARD 40 gold ⇒ 45 gold
			
		
	


	
		
			3/8 Kai'Sa Balance Update
			Base attack damage increased. Q cooldown and mana cost decreased.
			
				New champions always take some time for players to pick up. However, Kai'Sa is currently leaving the laning phase too far behind, which isn't giving players the opportunity to learn where she shines and how to play around that. For now, we're buffing up her early laning phase and cooldowns to give players better opportunities to master her kit.
			
			Kai'sa
			
				BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 62.46 ⇒ 65
			
			Q - Icathian Rain
			
				COOLDOWN 10/9/8/7/6 seconds ⇒ 8/7.5/7/6.5/6 seconds
			
			
				COST 55 mana ⇒ 45 mana

					Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void will be released with patch 8.5! Scope out League's latest predator while you're still alive:
				
				
						Champion Reveal
					
					
						Champion Spotlight
					
					
						Comic: Breach

					Kai'Sa's splashes will also be available on League Displays!
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Azir
				Q damage decreased.
				
					Azir has a strong laning phase and a strong late game. Lowering the base damage of Conquering Sands gives enemies more time to deal with the Emperor before his late-game AP scaling kicks in.
				
				Q - Conquering Sands
				
					DAMAGE 70/95/120/145/170 ⇒ 60/80/100/120/140
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Galio
				Q cooldown and mana cost increased at later ranks.
				
					Galio's ability to roam with Hero's Entrance is tied to how efficiently he can clear waves with Winds of War. A higher mana cost ties that waveclear (and the ensuing roams) more tightly to blue buff.
				
				Q - Winds of War
				
					COST 70/75/80/85/90 mana ⇒ 70/85/100/115/130 mana
				
				
					COOLDOWN 10/9/8/7/6 seconds ⇒ 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jhin
				Passive bonus attack damage increased. Q damage ratio increased. W can now root off all of Jhin's damage.
				
					Jhin is still a bit behind the curve for marksmen, and needs a bit more damage to scale into the late game.
				
				Passive - Whisper
				
					INNATE BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/16/20/24/28/32/36/40% total attack damage (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/14/16/20/24/28/32/36/40/44% total attack damage (at levels 1-18)
				
				Q - Dancing Grenade
				
					RATIO 40/45/50/55/60% total attack damage ⇒ 40/47.5/55/62.5/70% total attack damage
				
				W - Deadly Flourish
				
					updatedMORE CAPTIVATING Roots the first champion hit if they were recently hit by Jhin's basic attacks, damage from any allied champion, or are standing in a Lotus Trap ⇒ any damage from Jhin or his allies, or are standing in a Lotus Trap
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Nocturne
				Passive healing increased. Passive cooldown refresh on champion hit increased. Q missile speed increased.
				
					Nocturne may need some deeper-level changes in the future, but for now, some feel-good buffs should help him out given how weak he is at the moment.
				
				Passive - Umbra Blades
				
					BASE HEALING 10/18/26 (at levels 11/7/13) ⇒ 15-40 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					COOLDOWN REFRESH 1 second per hit on champion ⇒ 2 seconds per hit on champion
				
				Q - Duskbringer
				
					MISSILE SPEED 1400 ⇒ 1600
				
				W - Shroud of Darkness
				
					DAARRKNNEESSS If Shroud of Darkness is active when Nocturne re-casts Paranoia to dash to a target, it'll stay active until Nocturne reaches his target
				
				R - Paranoia
				
					BLACKOUT AND RECAST DURATION 4 seconds ⇒ 6 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Olaf
				E cooldown decreased. E total attack damage ratio increased. R flat bonus attack damage decreased. R bonus attack damage now scales with total attack damage.
				
					Olaf falls pretty flat as matches drag on. We're upping his scaling to help aggro Olaf players keep their blood pumping in later stages of the game.
				
				E - Reckless Swing
				
					COOLDOWN 12/11/10/9/8 seconds ⇒ 11/10/9/8/7 seconds
				
				
					RATIO 0.4 total attack damage ⇒ 0.5 total attack damage
				
				R - Ragnarok
				
					FLAT BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE 40/60/80 ⇒ 15/20/25
				
				
					newHIT EM HARDER Olaf now also gains 30% of his total attack damage as bonus attack damage for the duration

				Ferocity falls off more slowly. Q base damage increased. Q damage ratio decreased at early ranks, increased at later ranks.
				
					Our changes to Rengar last patch were focused on reintroducing Savagery's attack reset paradigm and adjusting some of the interactions between Rengar and his prey during Thrill of the Hunt. With those deeper behavioral changes locked in, we're taking 8.5 to assess some of the power concerns and feels-based oddities that emerged as a result.
				
				Passive - Unseen Predator
				
					FEROCITY FALL-OFF TIMER 6 seconds ⇒ 8 seconds
				
				
					updatedLOCKOUT ON FULL FEROCITY Only the spell used to gain full Ferocity is locked out
				
				
					LOCKOUT DURATION FOR Q AND E 0.25 seconds ⇒ 0.1 seconds
				
				Q - Savagery
				
					BASE DAMAGE 20/50/80/110/140 ⇒ 30/60/90/120/150
				
				
					RATIO 1.1 total attack damage ⇒ 1/1.05/1.1/1.15/1.2 total attack damage
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Empowered Savagery's attack was slightly faster than regular Savagery
				
				E - Bola Strike
				
					newPART OF THE PLAN If Rengar presses Q or W during Bola Strike's cast time, he'll now buffer those spells and cast them when Bola Strike completes
				
				R - Thrill of the Hunt
				
					newCAT EYES Rengar's true vision now lingers on his target until the leap completes, rather than when the leap starts
				
				Bugfixes
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Tiamat could sometimes cause Rengar's basic attacks to use Savagery's animation
				
				
					BUGFIX If Rengar was basic attacking a target before casting a spell, he'll now continue stabbing them when the spell completes rather than forgetting what he was doing and standing around awkwardly
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ryze
				E damage increased at early ranks. E spread damage decreased. R cooldown increased.
				
					Compared to other mages with good waveclear, Ryze's method (spread Spell Flux, then pop with Overload) is one of the more difficult to get right. Mistiming Spell Flux against a low-health minion often means you lose out on both the spread and the last hit, making the gap between high- and low-tier Ryzes particularly stark. Given that Ryze has been popping off in pro again (despite questionable performances on live servers), we're making Ryze's waveclear easier to access in the early game while reducing its overall potency. Realm Warp's cooldown is also targeted at pro play, given how much harder it is to coordinate in solo queue.
				
				E - Spell Flux
				
					DAMAGE 50/75/100/125/150 ⇒ 70/90/110/130/150
				
				
					SPREAD DAMAGE 100% ⇒ 50%
				
				R - Realm Warp
				
					COOLDOWN 120 seconds ⇒ 180 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Shyvana
				Attack damage per level increased.
				
					Last patch, we toned down Shyvana's scaling attack damage and Q - Twin Bite to compensate for the additional power Press the Attack was bringing. It turns out, those were too much combined, so we're reverting the scaling attack damage changes.
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH 2.8 ⇒ 3.4
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Skarner
				E stun duration decreased.
				
					So few people play Skarner that it took a while for us to notice how strong the patch 8.1 changes to Skarner had made him. Now that it's on our radar, we're splitting the difference between Fracture's pre- and post-8.1 stun duration to put him in a less oppressive spot.
				
				E - Fracture
				
					STUN DURATION 1.5 seconds ⇒ 1.25 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Swain
				Q cooldown decreased at early ranks. W radius increased. E radius increased. Champions no longer block Demon Flare missiles.
				
					Still focusing on usability for now, as Swain isn't that far off from being balanced.
				
				Q - Death's Hand
				
					COOLDOWN 7.5/6.25/5/3.75/2.5 seconds ⇒ 5.5/4.75/4/3.25/2.5 seconds
				
				W - Vision of Empire
				
					RADIUS 265 ⇒ 325
				
				E - Nevermove
				
					RADIUS Increased to match visuals from 70 ⇒ 100
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Nevermove was starting its return a frame too slowly
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Nevermove would sometimes not root its primary target hit by the return portion
				
				R - Demonic Ascension
				
					newOVERWHELMING Demon Flare now passes through champions. Effects like Yasuo's E - Windwall and Braum's E - Unbreakable still block the portion of the nova they intercept.
				
				
					BUGFIX Fixed a bug where Swain's ultimate cooldown indicator was displaying as always available to his allies
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Tristana
				Attack range decreased, especially at early ranks. W base damage increased.
				
					Tristana's early game strength allows her to coast too easily into the late game, so we're giving her a notable lane weakness (lower range) while still giving her a success case (all-ins).
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK RANGE 550-669 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 525-661 (at levels 1-18)
				
				W - Rocket Jump
				
					BASE DAMAGE 60/110/160/210/260 ⇒ 85/135/185/235/285
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Twitch
				E base damage increased.
				
					We went a bit too hard on Twitch last patch and are half-reverting Contaminate's nerf.
				
				E - Contaminate
				
					BASE DAMAGE 20/25/30/35/40 ⇒ 20/30/40/50/60
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Volibear
				E knockback duration decreased.
				
					The changes to Volibear were meant to give him the ability to disrupt mobility, allowing him a better chance to stick to targets who would otherwise dash away. However, the long duration is also just making it too consistent as a primary initiation or disengage tool.
				
				E - Majestic Roar
				
					updatedEXTRA SCARY Slightly increased the speed—but decreased the duration—of the knockback
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zoe
				Lots of changes. Primarily, Q does less AoE damage, and instead of applying More Sparkles!, does bonus base damage by level. Basic attack and W ranges increased.
				
					Now that we've taken away Zoe's oppressive strengths, we're looking to put power back in her kit where it's appropriate. We're decoupling Q - Paddle Star from Passive - More Sparkles!, but buffing its base damage and ratio and giving it its own per-level scaling. We're also upping Zoe's basic attack range and Spell Thief's damage to incentivize her to stick around after landing Paddle Star. This pushes Zoe to stay in threat range for a bit longer to hit her full damage output, giving opponents more of a chance to fire back in return.
				
				Base Stats
				
					ATTACK RANGE 525 ⇒ 550
				
				Q - Paddle Star
				
					DAMAGE 45/60/75/90/105 ⇒ 50/75/100/125/150
				
				
					newMORE DAMAGE Paddle Star's base damage is now increased by 7/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/22/24/26/29/32/35/38/42/46/50 (at levels 1-18)

					EXPLOSION DAMAGE 100% ⇒ 80%
				
				W - Spell Thief
				
					ENEMY LOCK-ON RANGE 525 ⇒ 550 (matching the buff to Zoe's attack range)

				Bugfixin'.
				E - Roar of the Slayer

	Items
	
		
			
				
				Banner of Command
				Siege minion bonus damage to turret effects from Banner of Command and Hand of Baron no longer stack.
				
					We knew going into last patch that we'd need to watch our changes to Hand of Baron closely—particularly when combined with Banner of Command on siege minions. Baroned+Bannered siege minions still deal more damage to turrets than they did in 8.3 (due to the bonus attack damage bugfix), but to a lesser extent than in 8.4.
				
				
					removedDOUBLE-DOUBLES Banner of Command's damage multiplier against turrets no longer stacks with the identical multiplier Hand of Baron grants to siege minions
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Enchantment: Cinderhulk
				Bonus health multiplier decreased.
				
					As the meta has grown more favorable to tanks—especially jungle tanks—Cinderhulk has gained in popularity. , to the point where non-tanks like Jax are picking it up.
				
				
					Percent Bonus Health Modifier 20% ⇒ 15%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Hextech GLP-800
				Active damage and slow increased.
				
					We brought the damage on GLP's active down when we updated it last patch since its component Lost Chapter is more appealing to bursty champs than Catalyst of Aeons, and we didn't want to turn GLP into a must-buy. While we did sidestep that risk, GLP is unappealing to everyone right now. We're upping its damage nerfs to make GLP a more enticing option.(...Upon further inspection, said damage nerfs missed the patch 8.4 notes. Sorry about that.)
				
				
					DAMAGE 75-150 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 100-200 (at levels 1-18)
				
				
					UNDOCUMENTED 8.4 RATIO NERF 0.35 ability power prior to 8.4 ⇒ 0.2 ability power in 8.4, unchanged in 8.5
				
				
					SLOW 40% ⇒ 65%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Warmog's Armor
				Health threshold for Warmog's Heart increased.
				
					The ability to poke, trade, and harass champions before forcing a fight is critical to many champions' play patterns, not to mention the whole laning phase. When poke doesn't stick, champions who rely on whittling down opponents are unable to set up favorable fights or even just force the enemy out of lane. On the whole, this discourages them from interacting with the enemy altogether. The Warmog's Heart passive is currently forcing this passivity too early in the game, and specifically at too low of an investment. We want champions to be able to opt into resisting poke patterns, but it should take more of a durability investment than just Warmog's Armor to do so.
				
				
					HEALTH THRESHOLD 2750 ⇒ 3000
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Turrets
	
		
			
				Damage to melee minions increased.
				
					The removal of bonus damage to minions has left some champions struggling to last-hit under tower.
				
				
					DAMAGE TO MELEE MINIONS 43% melee minion's maximum health ⇒ 45% melee minion's maximum health
				
				
					FREE BUGFIX The turret item tooltip for damage dealt to minions incorrectly listed 45%. That number is now correct.
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Jungle Objectives
	
		
			
				Cloud Drake Buff
				Rather than only granting out-of-combat movement speed, now grants movement speed at all times that increases while out of combat.
				
					Cloud Drake has always been good for pick-based compositions who want to catch opponents out of position, but not as appealing for other comps. We're shifting the movement speed to have both in and out of combat applications so more teams find it rewarding to take.
				
				
					newALWAYS FAST Now grants 2% bonus movement speed per stack, tripled while out of combat
				
				
					removedSOMETIMES FAST No longer gives 25 out of combat movement speed per stack
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Runes
	
		
			
				Precision-Domination Stat Bonus
				Bonus attack damage/ability power increased.
				
					Domination gives fewer stats than Sorcery because the keystones have more raw power. Somebody taking Domination secondary isn't getting a Domination keystone, so they should get the full stat bonus.
				
				
					ABILITY POWER BONUS 9 ability power ⇒ 10 ability power
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE BONUS 5.4 attack damage ⇒ 6 attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Press the Attack
				Damage amplification increased at early levels.
				
					Last patch, we sought to reduce a bit of the power Press the Attack had in the laning phase—particularly in duo lanes where two champions could take advantage of it. We went overboard, so we're returning to a midpoint.
				
				
					DAMAGE AMP 4-12% (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 8-12% (at levels 1-18)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Fleet Footwork
				Ranged penalty on minion heal increased.
				
					A number of marksmen are using Fleet Footwork like old Warlord's Bloodlust: to coast through the laning phase by using minions as health batteries. The counter to sustain should be an aggressive lane which can overcome it and all-in, but at the moment the main counter to Fleet Footwork is... Fleet Footwork, which means it's too strong. We're weakening that sustain so that opponents have a better shot at getting a meaningful laning advantage through poke and trades.
				
				
					RANGED CHAMPION HEALING OFF MINIONS 60% ⇒ 30%
				
				
					BUGFIX Fleet Footwork's total healing listed in the Runes panel now only increases when it actually heals you
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Aftershock
				Cooldown increased.
				
					When Aftershock activates, you can't kill its user. Then it explodes, and they damage you. In theory, you should now fight them in their window of weakness, but that window isn't meaningfully long (less than a minion wave!).
				
				
					COOLDOWN 20 seconds ⇒ 35 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Manaflow Band
				
					Now has a cooldown indicator!

	Open Parties
	
		
			
				Later this patch, it’s getting easier for friends and friends of friends to hop into your party ahead of game.
				
					Sending a bunch of game invites is a pain in the ass. Open parties now make your game appear on your friends’ um, friends lists. They can see what queue you’re in, your current party size, and join your team with one click. No invite required.
				
				
					OPEN PARTIES Are now a thing and will be on by default
				
				
					SHUT THE FRONT DOOR Can be turned off on the party screen with one click. The client remembers your setting.
				
				
					MUTUAL FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS When your friend joins an open party, their friends can then see the open party

	Loot Changes
	
		
			
				
					We’ve posted full loot tables on the Player Support site, which we'll keep updated whenever we make changes. Here are a few other changes coming this patch:
				
				
					NO CHEAP CHAMPS Now Hextech chests will only drop shards for champions worth 4800BE or more
				
				
					A LITTLE EXTRA OE When you get a ward skin shard from a Hextech Chest, it'll now come with 150 bonus OE
				
				
					BIG DROP, FREE UNLOCK Ultimate and Mythic skins will now drop as auto-redeeming permanents (no orange essence required to upgrade them). If you already own the skin, you'll be able to disenchant the permanent for orange essence.
				
				
					CHEAPER MASTERY Champion mastery 6 cost will be reduced by 800BE to 2450BE. Champion mastery 7 will be reduced by 950BE from 2950BE.

				Alistar can now correctly queue up orders other than Q - Pulverize during W - Headbutt
					The Bone Plating rune no longer goes on cooldown without doing anything when Yasuo's Passive - Way of the Wanderer activates
					Fixed a tooltip bug where selling Spellbinder then undoing the sell would restore the stacks you had before selling, but cause the counter on the buff bar to visually restart
					The Madness passive on Haunting Guise and Liandry's Torment no longer modifies true damage, matching rules around other damage-amplifying effects (ex. Vladimir's R - Hemoplague)
					Completing the quest line for Timeworn Targon's Brace and Timeworn Face of the Mountain no longer causes the Spoils of War passive to heal for an incorrect amount
					Lux's Q - Light Binding projectile now visually disappears after it hits a second target, since it doesn't actually do anything after that point
					Battlecast Cho'Gath's E - Vorpal Spikes no longer use classic SFX when Cho'Gath has 10+ stacks of R - Feast
					Dark Star Jarvan IV's recall VFX no longer appear underground when he uses Zhonya's Hourglass
					Forecast Janna’s “I'm live at the scene and it's just... cats and dogs here” VO line once again plays at the beginning of the match if conditions are met

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to patch 8.4, the one that's pretty huge. No, really. We've changed our patch cycle to alternate between larger game updates and shorter balance tweaks. This is probably our first true \"big patch,\" so it's structured differently than normal.
		First, we're looking into mage itemization, and there's been a minor overhaul on those items. Mages often have fixed build paths, so we wanted to give them new items—and revamp the old ones—to create more choice overall.
		After that, let's go top lane. We've seen a few top laners make the laning phase too consistent with sustain or base damage: Most champions can't fight them, and they can just avoid the ones who can. We want to make a more variant top lane, so we're addressing those outliers and working to make a more satisfying experience overall.
		Finally, we're pushing some big changes to a few champions we think require the gameplay changes. There's Zoe, Rengar, and Volibear, plus some smaller changes mixed in.
		Dig into the patch notes now so you're prepared to hop onto the Rift when the patch hits live!
		GLHF,

	Ability Power Items
	
		
			
				
					Mage itemization follows a pretty simple decision tree. If you need mana, get the only mana/cdr item (Morellonomicon). After that, buy the best general damage items (Void Staff and Liandry's). We want to give mages more options, so we're creating new mage items (and reshaping old ones) to provide more unique and focused outputs and let mages adapt their itemization to game states, matchups, and personal style.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Lost Chapter
				
					Lost Chapter, with its mana restore, is a nice item for mages who want to sustain in lane, which makes it a good starting point for most mid laners. As such, one of the first choices we want mages to be able to make is what item to build out of Lost Chapter. Lost Chapter builds into three items now: Luden's Echo, Hextech GLP-800, and Archangel's Staff. More on each of those below.
					(Catalyst of Aeons and its upgrades remain good items for the laner who wants to sustain in lane, trading cooldown reduction for health).
				
				
					TOTAL COST 900 gold ⇒ 1100 gold

				SAME The changes to Archangel's Staff carry over to Seraph's Embrace as well
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Liandry's Torment
				
					Liandry's Torment was a bit of a contradiction: The percent health damage made it decent against tanks, while the flat magic penetration made it decent against squishy targets. As a result, it either didn't do either job exceptionally, or it ended up overtuned, and doing both jobs too well. We're shifting Liandry's Torment into being the tank bleeding item, and rewarding champions who want to stay in combat for a while, casting spell after spell on the beefy boys.
				
				
					removedUNIQUE PASSIVE No longer grants Eyes of Pain: +15 flat magic penetration
				
				
					newUNIQUE PASSIVE Madness: Damaging champions increases the damage you deal by 2% per second until exiting combat (up to 10%)

				Morellonomicon
				Mana refund passive removed. Flat magic penetration added. Grievous Wounds now applies to targets at all health. Ability power decreased. Mana removed.
				
					Morellonomicon was supposed to be the anti-healing item, but when it was also the best mana and AP item and present in every game, it forced us to make the item more about the stats and less about the unique output it provided.
				
				
					BUILD PATH Lost Chapter + Fiendish Codex + Amplifying Tome + 665 gold ⇒ Oblivion Orb + Blasting Wand + 650 gold
				
				
					TOTAL COST 2900 gold ⇒ 3000 gold

					At the moment, too many champions (Gangplank and Ornn are definitely core offenders), are coasting their way through laning phase without needing to interact with their opposing laner. We're toning down the health and mana sustain of some of those picks, as well as weakening their ability to live in top lane from a safe range. We're also giving some love to the champions who tend to beat them so they'll be less safe of picks overall.
					There are also changes to Press The Attack, and be sure to check out the Jungle section for a change to Blast Cones which will impact top lane.

				Ornn
				W shield duration increased, cooldown decreased at early ranks, damage increased early and decreased late. Brittle duration decreased. E now deals more damage on average but cannot double-hit.
				
					Ornn has best-in-class dueling, so much so that he's not just one of the top tanks, but that he intrudes on what should be the strength of top lane fighters. Tanks aren't typically bad at dueling, but their cooldown gating and burstier damage outputs tend to give fighters clear chances to fight them and win. Ornn's windows of weakness are too short, whether that's the cooldown on W or the duration of the Brittle debuff. Even when he is fought outside of those windows, the damage from Searing Charge is too much for many champions to handle.

				Kalista
				Base attack damage and range decreased. Base attack speed and attack speed per level increased. W now grants attack damage instead of attack speed when Kalista is near her Oathsworn.
				
					Kalista has been bullying other marksmen too hard in lane, so we're bringing her mana sustain and attack range down somewhat.
					We're also changing the way Sentinel's Oathsworn bonuses work, and this one's a little bit of a deep dive. Gaining or losing attack speed (such as when her Oathsworn enters or leaves range) can make a champion feel choppy, leading to flubbed last-hitting and stutter-stepping. On Kalista, whose attack speed also controls movement, losing or gaining attack speed is even more disruptive. As such, we're changing the bonus she gets from being near her Oathsworn away from attack speed and into attack damage, and changing her base stat profile accordingly.
					TL;DR her power will still get a boost when her Oathsworn is nearby, but the feel of her basic attacks will feel more consistent throughout the course of a game.

				Rengar
				Q reverted to pre-rework paradigm. Base attack damage scaling increased. R detection range decreased.
				
					We like much of the Rengar update, but the old Q paradigm is one Rengar players enjoyed more (and opponents don't really notice that much). We want to keep—and amplify—the gains of the new ultimate while we're at it, and we're taking a pass at Rengar's stat profile to help Trinity Force be a more reasonable purchase.

					Over time, supports and marksman have picked up much better tools to prevent burst deaths (Redemption, Knight's Vow, et al). This makes Zed players feel worse about trying to make plays, knowing that if they fail, they'll be without a key cooldown for so long.

				Zoe
				A lot of changes. Most notably: Q damage down, minions no longer drop Teleport, E no longer refunds cooldown if it sleeps a champion, cleansing Drowsy now prevents Sleep.
				
					Ok, this one's a pretty big changelist. If you just want a TL;DR, we're nerfing the most frustrating parts of Zoe.
					First, Zoe's wave clear is good enough to frequently shove her lane in and roam—punishing the enemy mid laner with heavy poke damage if they try to follow. We're making wave clear one of Zoe's most notable weaknesses, meaning she'll have fewer opportunities to make use of her anti-champion strengths.
					Zoe's also getting to Sleep far too many targets, especially in teamfights where she's almost guaranteed to get her E cooldown reduction. Taking that refund away—and giving opponents better ways to remove Sleep—makes Sleep feel less unavoidable and brings her overall damage output down.
					Finally... Q - Paddle Star. Landing sleep into a long-ranged Q is Zoe's signature combo (and her largest source of damage), but even unsleeped targets are losing most of their health to one hit once Zoe has a few items. We're moving some damage into More Sparkles! and cutting a bunch more—the net result is about 20% less damage to the primary target at most points in the game.
					That's a lot of nerfs, and while Zoe is frustrating to play against, her win rate numbers aren't reassuring. We're bumping up her base health and passive scaling so she still has power, just less of the the \"one-shot you with naked Q\" levels she was sometimes reaching. This isn't an even swap: we expect Zoe to land on the weak side when 8.4 hits. But we'd rather hit as many frustration points as we can in one go and address power later, rather than continuing to draw the process out.

					Ancient Coin and its upgrades aren't doing as well as the other gold income items. In particular, they just don't offer much during the laning phase. Before, their quest reward was pulling some of that weight, but with that gone it needs something to make it worthwhile early on.
					By the way, there's currently a bug where the gold gained from Ancient Coin's pickups is not being reflected in the tooltip which tracks how much gold the item has accrued, but you still have the gold.

				Blast Cone
				Outer 4 blast cones spawn later in the game.
				
					The river-accessing blast cones (especially in top lane) put too much pressure on laners to not only win lane, but also control the early blast cone to avoid ganks. That gameplay is cool, but having it show up that early in the game is a bit much.
				
				The red dots are the affected spawns!

				Hand of Baron
				Baron buff bonus ability power increased. Baron buff stats increase more later in the game. Baron buff now buffs caster minions' durability.
				
					Late game Baron buffs should be hugely impactful, allowing a team which takes them to successfully siege those tough inhibitor turrets. It doesn't look like it's doing its job well enough, so we're bumping up the damage it provides as the game goes later (especially ability power), and boosting its minion buffs.

					INITIAL STATS 25 attack damage and ability power ⇒ 24 attack damage and 40 ability power
				
				
					FINAL STATS 40 attack damage and ability power at 27:30 ⇒ 48 attack damage and 80 ability power at 40:00
				
				Minion buffs
				
					A LARGE BUFF-FIX Fixed a bug where bonus attack damage (ex. Hand of Baron's +50 and Banner of Command's +100) wasn't affecting empowered siege minion attacks against structures at all. This is twice as impactful as it sounds, since empowered siege minions deal double damage to turrets.

					BUGFIX Hand of Baron's area-of-effect damage reduction buff on minions now properly reduces damage from Runaan's Hurricane bolts
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Elder Dragon Buff
				Elder Dragon respawn time decreased. Elder dragon buff duration increased for buffs beyond the first your team gets. Burn damage increased for elder dragon buffs beyond the first your team gets.
				
					Late game Elder Dragon buffs should be hugely impactful, allowing a team which takes them to successfully siege those tough inhibitor turrets. It doesn't look like it's doing its job well enough, so we're buffing all Elder Dragon buffs your team gets beyond the first, and dialing down the respawn timer. (Edit: To be clear, your team has to take multiple Elder Dragons to get the stronger buff. The second Elder Dragon of the game only gives the basic buff if the team that kills it wasn't also the team who killed the first Elder Dragon!)

  Greetings, Summoners,Welcome to patch 8.3, the one where Swain gets a shiny, updated kit. A few champions have been standing out not necessarily because they're the strongest champions, but because they're the most generalist, so
    we're sharpening their intended weaknesses to give opponents more deliberate counterplay.Then there's our iconic basic attackers. Master Yi and Tryndamere have been having a rough year, so we're giving them a bit more damage to help them
    be more relevant. We don’t intend to fix all of their problems this time around, just make them feel less weak.Finally, we're gnawing at the outliers of mid and marksman rosters. There are a few top picks that outclass the others, and
    some old favorites who have fallen heavily out of favor.So grab your Noxian demon arm, remember that the bird is the word, and get out on the Rift and crush your enemies.GLHF,

  
     Paul \"Aether\" Perscheid  Mattias \"Gentleman Gustaf\" Lehman     Lucas \"Luqizilla\" Moutinho

        Swain
        Swain's champion update launches with patch 8.3! For more intel on the Noxian Grand General, check these links:

        Azir
        Q cooldown increased at early ranks.
        Azir's early laning strength is keeping other mid laners from having enough early game agency, especially at higher levels of play.

        Q - Conquering Sands
        COOLDOWN
          11/9.5/8/6.5/5
          ⇒

        W - Arise!
        updatedCUT OFF THE HEAD
        Azir's soldier attacks now draw minion aggro to Azir.
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Jarvan IV
        Base armor decreased.
        We'd like Jarvan to have clearer weaknesses for his opponents to take advantage of. Dropping his base durability (especially against jungle monsters) should give early duelists a better shot at fighting him.

        Base stats
        BASE ARMOR

        Jhin
        R base damage increased at later ranks.
        The nerfs to Sorcery and Lethality put Jhin in a weaker spot than we'd like, so we're buffing some of his base damage back up.

        R - Curtain Call
        BASE DAMAGE
          50/115/180
          ⇒
          50/125/200
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Katarina
        Passive damage decreased.
        Even when she is shut down in lane, Katarina's high base damage helps her leave the laning phase relevant, even in losing matchups.

        Passive - Voracity
        DAMAGE
          75/80/87/94/102/111/120/131/143/ 155/168/183/198/214/231/248/267/287

        Kog'Maw
        W maximum health damage decreased at later ranks.
        Kog's damage is spiking too hard, even with one item. Less damage from his main basic attack murder tool should force him to rely more on items.

        W - Bio-Arcane Barrage
        MAXIMUM HEALTH DAMAGE
          3/4/5/6/7% target's maximum health

        Lucian
        Passive damage increased at early ranks. Passive crit damage increased.
        Lucian could use some love, but we want to make sure the majority of it is felt in more traditional bot lane carry oriented builds.

        Passive - Lightslinger
        SECOND SHOT DAMAGE
          40/50/60% of attack damage

        Master Yi
        Q mana cost decreased. E active base damage increased at early ranks and bonus attack damage ratio increased.
        Though we think Master Yi needs a lot of gameplay improvement, he doesn't need to be so weak in the meantime. We're giving him a bit more damage so he can stop feeling like Mister Yi.

        Ryze
        Activating Stopwatch or Zhonya’s now cancels Ryze’s ultimate as though he had been interrupted by crowd control.
        When the original decision was made to allow Ryze to use Zhonya's Hourglass to guarantee his ultimate, we were on the fence about this interaction, but it was deemed acceptable because he paid a significant cost to access it. Zhonya's Hourglass
          either came later in the game, or delayed core items in Ryze's already expensive build. Now that the Inspiration tree has made Zhonya's effect much easier to access, we’re not comfortable with keeping this low gameplay interaction intact.

        updatedTHE ULTIMATE CC
          Activating Stopwatch or Zhonya's now cancel's Ryze's ultimate as though he had been interrupted by crowd control.
        

      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Sejuani
        Q cooldown increased at early ranks.
        Like Jarvan, Sejuani is pretty good at everything: She’s a late-scaling tank with good damage and crowd control. She doesn't need such high early game mobility too, so we're dialing back on that.

        Q - Arctic Assault
        COOLDOWN
          13/12.5/12/11.5/11 seconds

        Tryndamere
          Base attack damage at later ranks increased. E bonus attack damage ratio increased. 
          Like Master Yi, Tryndamere could just use some more damage right now.

          Base Stats
          ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH STAT

        Viktor
        Q shield now increased by Augment: Turbocharge. R cooldown decreased at later ranks.
        In the past, Viktor's strength has been partially defined by his ability to one-shot opponents with Q - Siphon Power plus Lich Bane. We've changed his kit over time to reward him for staying near his enemies for longer, but now
          he's missing the tools to do so safely. We want to give Viktor players who regularly opt in to a riskier playstyle the tools to survive the punishment they take being up close and personal.

        Q - Siphon Power
        newTURBOCHARGED SHIELD
          Augment: Turbocharge now also increases Siphon Power's shield value by 60%
        

        R - Chaos Storm
        COOLDOWN
          120/110/100 seconds
          ⇒
          120/100/80 seconds
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        
        Zoe
        Q Cooldown increased.
        Paddle Star’s current cooldown doesn't give opponents long enough windows to take advantage of.

        Q - Paddle Star
        COOLDOWN
          7.5/7/6.75/6.5/6.25
          ⇒
          8.5/8/7.5/7/6.5
        
      
    
  

  
    
      
        Health Regeneration
        Cleaned up champions' base health regeneration stat to only include half or full numbers.
      
    
  

  
    
      
        Cho'Gath Ability VFX Updates
        Seriously, it's going to be sweet.
        Cho'Gath harkens back to the old days of LoL, and those ability particles show it. We've renovated each ability so that the Rift's biggest void murder monster can be as majestic as they deserve.

  Runes
    
      
        Inspiration
        The Inspiration tree—especially the combination of Magical Footwear and Perfect Timing—was giving too much of a gold advantage, when rune choices should be about what playstyle you want to opt into.

        
           KeystoneSummoner spell cooldown reduction decreased.
            Unsealed Spellbook is supposed to be the keystone for players who want to swap summoner spells and alter their capabilities mid-game. Turns out that much Summoner Spell cooldown reduction is good even if you never swap all game, so we're reducing
              the amount Unsealed Spellbook gives.

		Greetings, Summoners,
		Welcome to 8.2, the one where we make a pretty big systemic change. For the history of LoL, minions have rushed to defend their allies against any champion who hit them with a basic attack, but those same minions merely watched on as Pantheon chucked spears or Cassiopeia sank Twin Fang after Twin Fang into you. After this patch, no more. Minions now understand that targeted spells are mean, and they'll respond just as if they were basic attacks. This is a pretty big change, so we're headlining it here, but a full list can be found below.
		With that being said, there are a few junglers terrorizing the Rift recently, and we're taking the chance to knock them down a peg so that laners (and junglers) everywhere can feel a bit safer. Same goes for marksmen, and the names probably won't catch you by surprise.
		GLHF,

Mid-Patch Updates

	
		
			1/25/2018 Balance Update
			Nunu
			
				We wanted Nunu something to do with his hands, but it turns out we gave him too much. Dialing that back so he can settle in a good place.
			
			Q - Consume
			
				ON-HIT DAMAGE 3/5/7/9/11 (+5 per 100 ability power) ⇒ 1/2/3/4/5 (+5 per 100 ability power)
			
		
	


	
		
			Turret Durability
			Armor and magic resist increased early.
			
				We've added more and more ways to bust towers, and as a result, we're seeing the laning phase come to an end a bit earlier than we think is sufficient. Some early resistances should help extend the laning phase.
				This change went out at the beginning of the patch, it just didn't end up in patch notes.
			
			
				BASE ARMOR AND MAGIC RESIST 40 ⇒ 55
			
			
				SCALING ARMOR AND MAGIC RESIST +30 over 15 minutes ⇒ +15 over 15 minutes
			
		
	


	Patch Highlights
	
		
			
				
					
						
					
				
			
		
	
	Back to top

	Champions
	
		
			
				
				Ekko
				Bonus Attack Speed at Level 1 added.
				
					Ekko's pretty close to being able to jungle effectively, and this small bump should help him get back on that path without pushing his solo laning out of line.
				
				Base stats
				
					BONUS ATTACK SPEED AT LEVEL 1 0% ⇒ 10%
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Evelynn
				E damage decreased.
				
					Evelynn's burst is too damn high.
				
				E - Whiplash
				
					UNEMPOWERED DAMAGE 4% target's maximum health (+2.5% per 100 ability power) ⇒ 3% target's maximum health (+1.5% per 100 ability power)
				
				
					EMPOWERED 6% target's maximum health (+3.5% per 100 ability power) ⇒ 4% target's maximum health (+2.5% per 100 ability power)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ezreal
				Q damage decreased at early ranks.
				
					Kleptomancy has dramatically shifted Ezreal's power curve, making it far easier for him to get his core of Sheen/Tear of the Goddess earlier. As a result, Ezreal's power spikes (especially Trinity Force/Muramana) show up earlier and control the game for longer. It doesn't really make sense for him to have a safe lane phase (even bullying some laners) while also having best-in-class midgame power, so we're tuning down his early game strength.
				
				Q - Mystic Shot
				
					BASE DAMAGE 35/55/75/95/115 ⇒ 15/40/65/90/115
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Jinx
				Base attack damage decreased at early levels. Passive no longer stacks, but uncaps attack speed while Jinx is Excited. Minigun's attack speed no longer scales with level but scales harder with rank.
				
					We want to accentuate Jinx's wildcard nature by toning down her early game safety but ramping up her ability to snowball. That means upping her ability to take towers or win duels when she picks up early kills, and giving her a unique teamfight high when she gets rolling within a teamfight.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE ATTACK DAMAGE 66 ⇒ 61
				
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH STAT 2.41 ⇒ 2.7
				
				Passive - Get Excited!
				
					updatedTOO EXCITED Get Excited's attack speed no longer stacks
				
				
					newOVER 9000 Jinx's attack speed can exceed the cap while she is Excited
				
				Q - Switcheroo!
				
					updatedMINIGUN ATTACK SPEED 30/40/50/60/70% ⇒ 30/55/80/105/130%
				
				
					removedJINXED Minigun no longer gains attack speed based on Jinx's level
				

                    new  Jinx's first attack after switching to minigun comes out within .4 seconds of swapping
                
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kha'Zix
				Passive scaling decreased. Q scaling increased.
				
					Kha'Zix is supposed to shine when he can isolate a target and chain his abilities on them. At the moment, the damage on his passive is a bit too high, allowing him to win nonisolated fights he probably shouldn't. As a result, we're shifting some power out of his passive and into his Q.
				
				Passive - Unseen Threat
				
					RATIO 0.4 bonus attack damage ⇒ 0.2 bonus attack damage
				
				Q - Taste Their Fear
				
					RATIO 1.1 bonus attack damage ⇒ 1.2 bonus attack damage
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Malzahar
				Q scaling decreased. R cooldown increased.
				
					Malzahar's burst combo is a bit too consistent so we're lessening its frequency and overall damage.
				
				Q - Call of the Void
				
					RATIO 0.8 ability power ⇒ 0.65 ability power
				
				R - Nether Grasp
				
					COOLDOWN 120/100/80 seconds ⇒ 140/110/80 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Nunu
				Nunu now additionally does bonus magic damage on basic attacks. W now also increases ability power on both targets.
				
					Nunu just isn't very good right now.
				
				Q - Consume
				
					newTHESE HANDS Well Fed now additionally grants 3/5/7/9/11 (+5 per 100 ability power) magic damage on basic attacks
				
				W - Blood Boil
				
					newMAGIC FINGERS Now additionally increases ability power by 40% (max increase: 40/60/80/100/120) on both targets.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Ornn
				Ornn is no longer unstoppable during W. R cooldown increased.
				
					The usual counterplay to champions who stand still (or in Ornn's case, move slowly) while they churn out sustained damage is to displace them. Being unstoppable during W - Bellow's Breath just doesn't leave players with much gameplay against him. His ultimate cooldown also isn't leaving enemy teams with good windows to be aggressive, so we're tuning it up.
				
				W - Bellows Breath
				
					removedUNSTOPPABLE Ornn is no longer Unstoppable during this ability
				
				R - Call of the Forge God
				
					COOLDOWN 130/100/70 seconds ⇒ 140/120/100 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Pantheon
				
					We're changing the way targeted spells draw minion aggro, which has pretty significant implications for how Pantheon's passive functions.
				
				W - Aegis of Zeonia
				
					MINION AGGRO OP No longer blocks or is consumed by siege minion attacks
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Sona
				Q mana cost decreased.
				
					Our nerfs to Sona in response to the Runes overhaul went a little too far so we're restoring some power to her ability to poke in lane.
				
				Q - Hymn of Valor
				
					COST 60/65/70/75/80 mana ⇒ 50/55/60/65/70 mana
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Vayne
				Attack speed per level decreased. R bonus attack damage decreased.
				
					Vayne is just too strong right now. Fleet Footwork is giving her an easier path to the late game, and when she gets there, she's just rolling in stats. Rather than hit her laning phase (and put most of the pressure on her opposing bot laner), we're reducing her power in the late game.
				
				Base stats
				
					ATTACK SPEED GROWTH 4% ⇒ 3.3%
				
				R - Final Hour
				
					BONUS AD 30/50/70 ⇒ 20/30/40

				Resolve
					
						Keystone
					Aftershock
						Base damage decreased. Damage health scaling decreased but now scales with bonus attack damage and ability power. Flat resistances increased but no longer amplifies resistances by a percentage.
						
							Aftershock's base damage is a bit too high, and it's letting champions like Alistar or Leona run wild in early duels against marksmen. Having one mastery be so good for both durability and damage is warping interactions between tanks and squishier champions, so we're shifting the item profile to be less about damage and more about durability. While we're at it, we're shifting the resistances gain from percent to flat so that divers can get in on the fun, too.
						
						
							DAMAGE 40-140 (at level 1-18) ⇒ 10-120 (at level 1-18)
						
						
							HEALTH SCALING DAMAGE 3.5% maximum health ⇒ 3% maximum health
						
						
							newDAMAGE AD RATIO 0.15 bonus attack damage
						
						
							newABILITY POWER RATIO 0.1 ability power
						
						
							FLAT RESISTANCES 20 ⇒ 70-120 (at level 1-18)
						
						
							removedPERCENT RESISTANCES AMP No longer increases resistances by 30%
						
						Grasp of the Undying
						Ranged penalties in healing, damage, and health gain decreased.
						
							Taking advantage of Grasp of the Undying is way easier if you're ranged, so we wanted to make sure it was less impactful on ranged champions. However, it seems like we went too far; even champions like Gnar and Urgot don't perform well with it.
						
						
							RANGED HEALING AND DAMAGE REDUCTION 50% ⇒ 40%
						
						
							RANGED PERMANENT HEALTH PER PROC 2 ⇒ 3
						
						Guardian
						Cooldown increased at early levels, decreased at late levels. Shield base value and ratios increased.
						
							Guardian is the newest in \"hidden power\" mechanics: Like Bond of Stone or Aegis of the Legion's old aura, players are getting a lot of power from it, but they often don't feel it. We want to make Guardian a little weaker (it's overperforming), but also more noticeable (it's underappreciated).
						
						
							COOLDOWN 45 ⇒ 70-40 (at level 1-18)
						
						
							BASE SHIELD 60-150 (at level 1-18) ⇒ 70-150 (at level 1-18)
						
						
							SHIELD AP RATIO 0.20 ability power ⇒ 0.25 ability power
						
						
							SHIELD HEALTH RATIO 10% bonus health ⇒ 12% bonus health
						
					
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Inspiration
					
						Keystone
					Glacial Augment
						Slow amount increased.
						
							Glacial Augment is underperforming (there is only one champion who performs best with it, and it's Aurelion Sol), so we're buffing it up.
						
						
							MELEE SLOW 40-50% (at level 1-18) ⇒ 45-55% (at level 1-18)
						
						
							RANGED SLOW 20-40% (at level 1-18) ⇒ 30-40% (at level 1-18)
						
						
							ACTIVE ITEM SLOW 50% ⇒ 60%
						
						Kleptomancy
						Gold value of pilfered items decreased.
						
							The gameplay of getting a lot of small, mini-use active items is cool, but too often it's optimal to just sell everything and accelerate builds. We want to make sure that there's a reasonable tradeoff between using those items and just cashing them in. Since Kleptomancy is also overperforming, we're also bringing the drop rate down, especially early game and on ranged champions.
						
						
							updatedLESS LOOT Drop rate significantly decreased in the first 15 minutes of the game
						
						
							updatedLESS LESS LOOT After 15 minutes, drop rate slightly decreased for melee, significantly decreased for ranged
						
						
							updatedBUYER'S MARKET Sell values about 20% lower

	Targeted Spells
	
		
			
				Targeted damaging spells draw minion aggro.
				
					Champions with spammable targeted spells, like Pantheon and Cassiopeia, put opposing laners in an awkward position: fight back and draw minion aggro, or just take the punishment they hand out. Changing this mechanic will make those champions a lot more intuitive to play against, as well as easier to balance.

		Greetings, Summoners,
		It's the first patch of the new season, and that means it's our last chance to make changes before the season starts! We already had an extra patch (7.24b) to round out the preseason leading into the holiday break, so this patch is a good deal smaller than usual.
		The Ranked ladder resets with this patch, so we’ll see you out there for placements. To go with that, there are a few updates to the Honor system aimed at rewarding honorable players with some sweet loot!
		GLHF!

	Patch Highlights
	
		
			
				
					If you’re following our Facebook page, this video should look familiar. We figured we’d see what happens if we put it in the Patch Notes, too!

		Start of Season
	
		
			
				
					Note: these changes will come into effect when the season starts on January 16.
				
				
					RANKED The 2018 Ranked season begins in the early morning of January 16
				
				
					HEXTECH CHESTS You can once more earn Hextech chests for each champion by getting an S- or higher rank in game
				
				
					We saw that Challenger players were facing Master tier duos pretty regularly, which ends up making the queue less competitive overall (despite the original intention back in 2016), and also punishes duos on the upper echelons of Master for winning too hard. We’ll be monitoring how much this impacts the health of the queue over the coming weeks
				
				
					CHALLENGER TIER In Ranked Solo/Duo, Challenger players can now duo queue

	Champions
	
		
			
				
				Brand
				Passive damage-over-time increased.
				
					Brand was one of the top users of Deathfire Touch, and without it, his baseline damage is lacking.
				
				Passive - Blaze
				
					DAMAGE PER STACK 2% target's maximum health ⇒ 4% target's maximum health
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Evelynn
				E buff-fix.
				E - Whiplash
				
					BUFF-FIX Whiplash no longer goes on cooldown if it fizzles due to Evelynn losing vision of her target during its cast time.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Graves
				Q cost and cooldown decreased. W slows more heavily but for less time.
				
					Graves has an unreliable early game. His burst damage is high enough that it doesn't need an increase, so we made some small changes to give him more room to shine early.
				
				Q - End of the Line
				
					COST 60/70/80/90/100 mana ⇒ 60/65/70/75/80 mana
				
				
					COOLDOWN 14/13/12/11/10 seconds ⇒ 13/12/11/10/9 seconds
				
				W - Smoke Screen
				
					SLOW STRENGTH 15/20/25/30/35% ⇒ 50% at all ranks
				
				
					SLOW DURATION 1.5 seconds ⇒ 0.5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Heimerdinger
				Big turret beam damage decreased.
				
					Ya boy Heimerdinger does some serious damage. Probably too much, in fact...
				
				R - UPGRADE!!!'d Q - H-28G Evolution Turret
				
					BEAM BASE DAMAGE 200/270/340 ⇒ 100/140/180 (0.7 ability power ratio unchanged)
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Kayle
				Attack damage growth and bonus attack speed reduced. E cooldown increased early and decreased later.
				
					Without the stats (namely CDR) from the old rune system, Kayle has a harder time reaching full uptime ranged attacks with Righteous Fury. On the other hand, most of the new runes gave her more damage overall. We're trimming back on basic attack damage, while making it easier for her to reach full E - Righteous Fury uptime more easily.
				
				Base stats
				
					ATTACK DAMAGE GROWTH 2.8 ⇒ 2.2
				
				
					INNATE BONUS ATTACK SPEED 15% ⇒ 10%
				
				E - Righteous Fury
				
					COOLDOWN 16 seconds at all ranks ⇒ 18/17/16/15/14 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Skarner
				E proc deals more damage and stuns for longer. Base mana increased.
				
					Skarner has been pretty weak in the preseason, so we're buffing up his damage, crowd control, and mana.
				
				Base stats
				
					BASE MANA 272.2 ⇒ 320
				
				E - Fracture
				
					PROC DAMAGE 25/35/45/55/65 ⇒ 30/50/70/90/110
				
				
					PROC STUN DURATION 1 second ⇒ 1.5 seconds
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Syndra
				A lot of R bugfixes.
				
					Weird things have been happening if Unleashed Power's target died or became invulnerable before every sphere dealt damage. We've fixed a lot of those bugs.
				
				R - Unleashed Power
				
					OVERKILL All Dark Spheres now consistently fly at Unleashed Power's target, even if the target dies or goes invulnerable
				
				
					THREE IN THE CHAMBER The three spheres orbiting Syndra now properly materialize even if Unleashed Power's target dies as the ability is cast
				
				
					DON’T YOU TAKE ME TO Syndra's movement no longer becomes funky for a few seconds if Unleashed Power's target dies before all spheres have fired
				
				
					BALLS ON THE FIELD Dark Spheres that didn't damage Unleashed Power's target now properly interact with Syndra's other abilities
				
				
					BALLDERDASH Dark Spheres that didn't damage Unleashed Power's target no longer move erratically when affected by Syndra's other abilities
				
				
					STEADY HANDS Dark Spheres created shortly after Unleashed Power ends no longer move erratically when affected by Syndra's other abilities
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				
				Zoe
				E trap arm time increased. R exit portal delay decreased.
				
					Zoe's skillshots hit or missed based mostly on her skill, not her opponents'. We want to give a bit more room for players to actively dodge Zoe's damage, so we're giving players more time to see where Zoe (or her skillshots are) before they're struck.
				
				Q - Paddle Star
				
					updated Now does not register Zoe's new position (for purposes of Q range) until she has fully emerged from R - Portal Jump
				
				W - Spell Thief
				
					updated Minions can no longer drop shards for Hextech Gunblade
				
				E - Sleepy Trouble Bubble
				
					DELAY BEFORE TRAP IS CREATED 0.6s ⇒ 0.8s
				
				R - Portal Jump
				
					DELAY BEFORE EXIT PORTAL APPEARS 0.1s ⇒ 0s
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Varus Splash Update
				
					Exactly what it says~

	Runes
	
		
			
				Predator
				Addressing a few feels-bad parts of Predator.
				
					Predator is still a bit awkward to use, so we're introducing some usability tweaks to make its activation more consistent and its proc more intelligent.
				
				
					newPARTIAL REFUND If Predator's channel is interrupted, 50% of the cooldown is now refunded
				
				
					newHUNT THE WEAK If Predator's bonus damage is proc'd via an area-of-effect ability, it will now prioritize the lowest-health target hit
				
				
					newADRENALINE Predator's rate of movement speed increase is increased by 50% for the first second and a half of the effect. This is unlisted in the tooltip because if you're making decisions around it, you're probably overthinking things.
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Resolve Path Stat Bonuses
				Stat bonuses are now split between health and the stat provided by your secondary rune path, and provide the same amount regardless of whether Resolve is primary or secondary.
				
					Taking Resolve tree secondary was a pretty good call in the old system because runes and masteries combined gave you a decent chunk of baseline durability. Without that stat infusion, taking Resolve (in the new system) doesn't feel great. We're changing the way Resolve grants stats as a primary/secondary tree in order to make it a more viable secondary tree.
				
				Resolve primary
				
					RESOLVE + SORCERY 130 health ⇒ 65 health plus 10 ability power or 6 attack damage, adaptive
				
				
					RESOLVE + DOMINATION 130 health ⇒ 65 health plus 9 ability power or 5.4 attack damage, adaptive
				
				
					RESOLVE + PRECISION 130 health ⇒ 65 health plus 9% attack speed
				
				Resolve secondary
				
					SORCERY + RESOLVE 20 ability power or 12 attack damage, adaptive ⇒ 65 health plus 10 ability power or 6 attack damage, adaptive
				
				
					DOMINATION + RESOLVE 18 ability power or 10.8 attack damage, adaptive ⇒ 65 health plus 9 ability power or 5.4 attack damage, adaptive
				
				
					PRECISION + RESOLVE 18% attack speed ⇒ 65 health plus 9% attack speed
				
			
		
	
	
		
			
				Runes Bugfixes
				Unsealed Spellbook now properly updates its user's Summoner Spell icons in Spectator Mode
					End-of-game runes stats that report duration (ex. Lethal Tempo's \"Total Active Time\") now use 00:00 formatting instead of number of seconds active
					Glacial Augment & Arcane Comet now have ally/enemy color differentiation
					Ally hits will no longer count towards Electrocute if both allies have the Keystone equipped
					Fixed interactions between the Flash lockout on Skarner and Fiddlesticks' ults and the Hextech Flashtraption and Unsealed Spellbook runes, which could cause Skarner and Fiddlesticks to lose access to Flash and Hexflash
					Rengar can no longer extend his leap range from brush via Hextech Flashtraption
					Triumph's gold and healing are now properly granted to units in stasis when a takedown is earned
					Arcane Comet's tooltip now properly lists its base damage
					Kleptomancy's level-up UI no longer persists when using Elixir of Skill at Level 18
					Cleaned up Runes VFX in Spectator VFX to remove overlapping particles
					Manaflow Band now works properly with alternate HUD schemes (Flipped Minimap, Team Frames on Left, etc.)
					Fixed a bug where abilities that cost health to cast will cause Revitalize's bonus healing amount in the rune panel to decrease.

	Item Selling
	
		
			
				
					Normally, selling an item means buying another right after. Selling and then leaving base immediately is mostly the product of misclicking.
				
				
					SELLER'S REMORSE If you close the item shop within 0.25 seconds of selling an item, the sale is cancelled
				
			
		
	
	Back to top
	Healthbar Update
	
		
			
				Readability Improvements
				Higher contrast red health
					Darker background (to pop health even more)
					Bigger, brighter level text
					Slightly slimmer border
					Smaller name text (creates contrast with CC states and room for club tags)
				
		
	
	
		
			
				Bug Fixes
				Shield decay displaying as red damage (fixed in 7.24 cycle)
					Club tags are back

		Honor
	
		
			
				
					Honor in 2018 is seeing some changes based on your feedback. Fighting to win earns you more rewards that get better as you level up. New checkpoints between Honor levels let you track your progress. Just like Ranked, your Honor level resets at season start so you can claim rewards all over again. These changes will ship at season start!
				
				Checkpoints
				
					There are now three checkpoints in between each Honor level. For every checkpoint after level 2, you’re guaranteed a reward to celebrate your progress. Checkpoints stop after Honor level 5 (because there’s no level 6), but you’ll still get rewards at the same intervals
				
				Honor Reset
				
					Your Honor level resets at season start to a checkpoint between levels 2 and 3. Players who finished at levels 3, 4, and 5 earn a small boost depending on their level.
				
				
					RESET 5 Level 5 ⇒ Level 2, checkpoint 3
				
				
					RESET 4 Level 4 ⇒ Level 2, checkpoint 2
				
				
					RESET 3 Level 3 ⇒ Level 2, checkpoint 1
				
				
					RESET 2 Level 2 ⇒ Level 2, no checkpoints
				
				
					RESET 1/0 Level 1 and below do not reset
				
				New Rewards
				
					We’ve made some big adjustments to how rewards work. New keyless Honor Orbs drop at every checkpoint past level 3 and keep coming after Honor level 5. Honor Capsules now drop when you reach levels 3, 4, and 5. That means you’ll get fewer Capsules than before, but they’ll contain the most exclusive rewards. Orbs and Capsules give you better rewards with every level up. Here’s what you’ll earn every time you level up or reach a checkpoint.
				Level 1
				
					LEVEL UP 1 Key
				Level 2
				
					LEVEL UP 1 Key
				
				
					CHECKPOINT 2 Key fragments
				Level 3
				
					LEVEL UP Level 3 Capsule containing 3 Key fragments, a ward skin, and 300 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard
				
				
					CHECKPOINT Level 3 Orb containing 2 Key fragments and 150 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard
				Level 4
				
					LEVEL UP Level 4 Capsule containing 4 Key fragments, an emote, and 630 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard
				
				
					CHECKPOINT Level 4 Orb containing 2 Key fragments and 200 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard
				Level 5
				
					LEVEL UP Level 5 Capsule containing 5 Key fragments, Grey Warwick or Medieval Twitch, and 960 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard. If both skins are owned, you’re guaranteed an emote or ward skin instead.
				
				
					CHECKPOINT Level 5 Orb containing 3 Key fragments and 250 Blue Essence or a higher value Champion Shard

	Bugfixes
	
		
			
				Fixed a bug where Galio's shield from W - Shield of Durand would expire, rather than refresh 12 seconds after taking damage
					Champions with manaless abilities (such as Elise or Nidalee in Cougar form) can no longer stack Tear of the Goddess with their manaless abilities
					Energy or resourceless champion—such as Riven or Yasuo—can no longer stack Tear of the Goddess. Their allies can still stack tears, however.

					QTPie—oops, we mean Zac—will no longer get stuck in his R - Let's Bounce! animation continuously if he revives with Guardian Angel after during the cast animation

					Super Galaxy Gnar's transformation to and from Mega Gnar has been visually changed to remove a seizure risk

					Fixed very rare instances where canceling an auto attack could also cause an in-flight projectile (ex. E - Grasping Roots) to disappear
					Fixed a bug where chaining certain dashes together would cause the second dash to last for the same duration as the first. If any Maokais were wondering why W - Twisted Advance took so long to reach a target after exiting Tahm Kench's R - Abyssal Voyage... that's why.
					Clicking on an enemy tower will now consistently show its item inventory
					Elementalist Lux's R - Final Spark water form VFX have been restored

					Animal VFX for Spirit Guard Udyr's dance have been restored when he's in rank five W - Turtle Stance
					Hextech Kog'Maw's E - Void Ooze VFX around the spit blob projectile no longer disappear beneath elevated terrain
